How many vines would you start with?,"Hi all- 

&amp;#x200B;

Wine lover and avid plant grower here. I want to grow grapes to make my own (dry, red) wine. Thinking of a merlot variety, or perhaps a nebbiolo, but I know that might be tricky as I am in zone 6b, south east PA. 

I have made mead before, and have the equipment for wine making for the most part. I have a love for growing plants, and I think I can manage a grape harvest. 

My question is, how many grape vines should I plant in order to produce enough grapes for lets say...5-10 gal of wine, per year? Space isn't a huge issue, though I'd like to be able to manage it efficiently.

Thanks for any pointers!",winemaking
Misc CO2 / Oxygen protection question ...,"I have a wine batch that has CO2 naturally dissolved in it from the primary fermentation.

Do I need to burn through all of that CO2 before I start damaging it with oxygen contact ?

OR ...

Is it possible to do both things at once - continue to have some amount of fizziness but also did some unwanted damage with oxygen ?

I guess what I am asking is ...

If I am concerned about oxygen management, does the fact that my wine is still a little fizzy prove that I did a good job managing it ?",winemaking

"Making drinkable wine in Frankfurt, Germany?","I plan to grow a very small amount of grapes in a small garden in the city of Frankfurt. It should be zone 7a to 8b according to different sources.

Do you think this will ever result in drinkable results - especially if one does not have any experience? 

I prefer drinking red wine, but I guess a white grape variety will be better suited to the climate, right?  
Which of the following do you think will give the overall best experience in growing and drinking.   


1. Cabernet Sauvignon
2. Cabernet Franc
3. Merlot
4. Pinot Noir
5. Carmenere  

6. Riesling
7. Semillon
8. Chardonnay

Skin Contact White - Aging on Skins Questions,"Hey guys,

I am planning on making a skin contact white wine. I have read that some winemakers have aged on skins for a couple of months, something I want to try. 

So my questions are:

* After the initial fermentation would I transition everything (skins and all) in the fermentation barrel to demijohns and just let them age for my desired time in them?
* When I decide to take it off skins, would I just rack the wine off the skins/lees into new demijohns?
* Should I not bother pressing at all because it will be a bit much after being on skins for a long time? And the oxidization via pressing would ruin the wine?

Thanks!",winemaking

Leave wine in primary fermenter until bubbling stops?,"I'm new to winemaking and using a Sauvignon Blanc kit (WineBuddy brand - I'm in UK).

Instructions say to leave in the primary fermenting bucket for 6 days, with fermentation deemed complete if specific gravity is less than 0.996. It's been 8 days and it's still bubbling away. Admittedly, it's been at a slightly lower temp than the 20-25 degrees C that was recommended, which I guess could make it take longer.

I haven't checked the gravity yet. If I do and it is &lt; 0.996, should I consider fermentation complete and move onto the next step even if it still bubbling? Will it do any harm to leave it another week or so in the hope that the bubbling stops?",winemaking
Malic smell/flavor in Cab Sav,"Hello all, I recently went to bottle a Cab that has been in a carboy for about 6 months and noticed a strong aroma and taste of malic acid, its very green apple and offputting.

Aging wine many years?,"Hi all. I’ve read that homemade wine can last 5-7 years under the best conditions. And yet I see documentaries where they open up bottles from the WW2 era like they are the most precious thing in the world. And apparently still taste good, unless the people in the docs are lying. 

I’ve been making wine for several years now but it never lasts more than two years before it gets consumed. We recently found out I’m going to be a father soon! I thought it would be super cool to age some wine from the year they are born and pop a few bottles open for their 21st bday. I’ve asked around a little bit and got some advice like: be sure to add potassium sorbate and a lot of Kmeta at bottling, purge the bottles with Argon at bottling, bulk aging is better, etc… Obviously I know the wine would have to be kept at cellar temps and away from any and all sunlight.

Forgotten wine...will it kill me?,"I used to be very involved with making wine from grapes but past 5-6 years have gotten away from it.  Cleaning out the basement, I realized I had two 5 gal carboys of wine sitting there peacefully.  The airlocks were dried out so I was prepared to dump it....but since it was breaking my heart I decided to pour some out.  Colour still looked red, didn't look oxidized (usually turns to a red-brown).  Then I sipped some and it wasn't half bad!

"I failed to kill the yeast, advice?","I'm a beginner (unless you count making jury-rigged fruit wine out of whatever juices and fruits we dumpster dived when I was a teen, lol), and bought a ready-made kit, one of those that has all the ingredients one's supposed to need and instructions on how to do it properly. I thought I followed the instructions, but apparently I failed; I suspect my failure was that when it said to 'vigorously shake' the whole fermenter after adding the yeast stopping agent, I quickly realized that I'm not strong enough to shake it and so instead stirred it with a ladle. I suspect that was simply insufficient, and some yeast particles remained alive.

I didn't notice this until later on though. At the end of the process, one was supposed to add a bit of sugar if one wanted to sweeten the wine, which I did, so I added a bit of sugar before transferring the wine to mainly plastic jerrycans. However, I've now noticed that there's been carbon building, indicating that it's fermenting again. Tasting it, I can notice the yeast when looking for it, but it's not overpowering or anything and the wine still tastes good (so far).

My questions are:

- Can I simply add more yeast killer now afterwards to stop the process, and if I do so, will the dead yeast collect at the bottom so I can re-bottle the wine without getting it in there?

- Do I overall need to worry about the yeast being there, apart from the minor effect it has on taste?

I am writing my college thesis on the securty aspects of industrial winemaking. Can the people of r/winemaking help me?,"Tl,Dr: I am writing a college thesis on healthy and safety on industrial winemaking, and due to covid-19 restrictions, i can't do a guided visit to a vineyard to learn the proccess. I have a few questions i'd be really happy if the people of this reddit could answer, as my graduation depends on passing this thesis. Thank you very much for your time.

I am a college student, studying to become a health and safety advisor, writing my thesis on health and safety on the industrial sector, and i chose to write it on industrial winemaking, as it is related to a previous work i wrote on health and safety in the harvest process of vineyards.

Ideally, i would be basing my thesis on guided visits to vineyards, but due to my country's COVID-19 situation, that isn't a possibility for me right now, so i don't have a proper way to get first hand knowledge of how industrial winemaking works.

Could the winemakers of this subreddit help me?  


QUESTIONS START HERE:

For those that are willing to give a hand, what i need is a step by step guide on how red wine is made on an industrial level.

I have the basics figured out, starting from the destemming to crushing and pressing, maceration and fermentation, clarification, aging, and bottling, yet what i am missing, is the actual first hand aspects of the process: 

What do the employees do during the production process? What are their tasks? How do they clean the machines? What chemicals are used in the process?

What machines are used? How you get the grapes from the destemming machine to the crusher? How do you get the wort from the crusher to the maceration tank, and then to the aging tanks and from there to bottling, etc   


What does the factory look like? Do workers need to get on top of the tanks or stairs? To second levels? Are there any clear safety risks on the process? Questions of the like.

If any of you is willing to answer the questions in this post, and maybe a few more, i'll be extremely gratefull, as it'll be a great help in order to write my thesis.

This is exclusively for educational purposes. I have no intention of starting a vineyard in the future, nor are my next educational goals based on that work-field.

Suggestions for bourbon barrel staves?,"(I hope you don't mind posting from a throwaway, this post will identify me to people IRL)

I got ahold of some staves from a bourbon barrel that will be a gift for a relative who makes wine (in 5 gallon batches). I'm looking for input on how to best make use of the staves - to actually use them the wood has to be broken down into pieces that will fit in the carboy, and the wood has to be sanitized. I explain my thoughts below, but does anyone have any suggestions on how to process them properly? Has anyone done this before?

I haven't made wine, although I have made beer so I at least have indirect familiarity with some of the equipment and processes. I may as well be up front and mention that the distillery was very generous with the cost of the wood, so I can live with waste or losing some of the flavor from the wood as needed to minimize any risk of ruining a batch of wine if something goes wrong (or, if need be, taking the tough advice that they won't be usable).

My initial thought is to:

&amp;#x200B;

* Cut the wood into chips that can fit into the mouth of the carboy (with a hand saw)
* Sand down the outside of the staves (they were exposed to the warehouse so I can't risk dirt or anything else being on the wood), as well as the surfaces cut by the saw
* Power wash all surfaces to ensure any sawdust or any residue are removed, although I'd try to avoid removing the toasted surface
* Boil the wood to sanitize (on the day the wine is made) - some websites suggest the wood can then be microwaved to dry it a bit
* Use a tied off muslin bag to make them easy to remove together (as used for hops in brewing, though boiled first to sanitize)

I also expect that it would be best to use a mix of unused oak (from typical wine kit stores) and bourbon barrel wood at first, and experiment from there, whether by adjusting ratios of wood or using a 2-stage process.",winemaking

I am very much into making my own wine, grape and other fruits and such.  Ive only been doing it since the end of May/June, so I learning as I go. 

What i have made so far my first wine is Dandelion, then Lilac wine. I really could not have probably started off with anything more difficult lol.  I spent 3 hours picking about 40 quarts of Dandelion flowers from my friends organic farm.  He was happy he said that was the smallest amount of blooming Dandelions he has seen in years.  

&amp;#x200B;

The lilac was also from a friends. She was cutting her bush down because she was putting in a pool so I offered it cut it down in exchange for the blooms.  About 25 lbs in blooms later the bush was gone and he pol was up. 

The Dandelion wine I got 14 bottles with a 10% abv with a nice orange citrus floral flavor with honey in the end. 

The Lilac is kinda weird its also a sweet floral and smells for every bit like lilac ( who would have guessed that). Flavor wise i get berries.  I got 12 bottles from that. 13% abv

My Peach came from about 40 lbs of peaches. Taste like well peaches lol i got 26 bottles of that.  With an ABV of 12.5%

The Cherry this one was surprising i got 12 bottles out of it i dont remember the amount of cherries i used but it would have been over 16 lbs. The ABV is 13.5%. This smells like summer cherries with a hint of bubblegum. 

All had to be back sweetened with the Dandelion and Lilac just enough to cut the dryness.

After seeing this I just mushed everything up and gave it a stir. Now it's looking better to me although I am seeing some pale looking fruit. Is this normal looking? Should I be concerned about the white area in the first photo even if it's gone now?

Also, the airlock isn't bubbling but I'm pretty sure the lid is leaking a bit which I believe is fine for primary fermentation. Does that sound right?

Home made sparkling pineapple wine,"Hi everyone, 

I was hoping I could find some advices for my first fermenting experience!

I work in a bar and often I find myself with some leftover (expired) juices which I hate pouring down the sink.. Recently had to discard a few litres of a really good quality pineapple juice that I couldn't use anymore, there come the idea of transforming that juice into something else, I thought I could buy some yeast of amazon, pour it in the bottle and wait for a week before I get some delicious pineapple wine, then I thought that its may not be as easy as it sounds...

The juice is supplied by a company that sells high quality, seasonal, cold pressed juices without additives, with a short shelf life.

So here I am, looking for an advice form you! 

I'd like to make it a little project and keep some of you updated, I do understand fermentation however I've never made a fermented product myself.

I saw a couple of videos on how to ferment juices and I always find people adding loads of sugar into the juice before fermenting it, is that necessary? Isn't the juice itself sweet enough?

Which kind of yeast should I opt for? how much will that impact the flavour?

Do I need stainless steel or glass fermentation vessel, or I can use the plastic bottle that the juice comes in?

How long do I ferment for? where? at what temperature?

How do I approach the second fermentation if I want sparkling wine? Is it worth it? How long would that take?

What to expect from the final product? Is it worth the effort?

What size fermenter to use?,"Hello, 

I've got 10.5 gallons of Pinot Gris thawing and was wondering how the best way to ferment might be. I have two options, use two regular fermenter buckets that hold up to 7 gallons which gives it enough space.

"First time making wine from grapes, can I get a review of my process here?","It's a 5 gallon pail of Cabernet Franc and arrived almost completely frozen. I wrapped it up in a sleeping bag and blankets and let it sit in the 30-50 degree range for 3 days, then removed everything and let it get to about 65 before pitching my yeast (RC212). Fermentation started on 12/24 at 1.103 OG.


Fermentation is going pretty well, currently sitting at 1.032. I've been punching the cap probably 4-5 times a day (maybe more than needed, but it's fun).


Current plan is to reduce cap punching to 2-3 times a day and gently degass without aerating for the remainder of the fermentation. I'm probably going to rack and press on the 3rd, after 10 days on the skins (aside from the cold maceration).


If it reaches absolute dryness before then, should I rack earlier? My current thought is that if it does go completely dry before then, I'll probably hit it with about 50ppm sulfites, then punch 1-2 times a day until the 3rd to try to avoid oxidation, then add a smaller does of sulfites on pressing. Am I increasing risk by doing this?


Last note - I'm planning on very lightly pressing the skins, then fermenting a Pinot Noir kit on them. Any issues there?

Failed fermentation?,"First timer here- I acquired half a pallet of pineapples which had been in a damaged semi trailer. They did have brown areas, I believe that the fruit has been frost damaged (It’s Minnesota in December). I decided wine was the correct path. I have four 6 gallon buckets, all of them essentially the same with the exception of one bucket being a skinnier, taller bucket. I processed and bagged all the fruit in each bucket, everything was well sterilized. I saw a lot of bubbles in all buckets prior to campden tablets, my assumption was that natural yeast was starting. I added 6 campden tablets per bucket even though a couple of the buckets were slightly below the 6 gallon mark. The buckets were left for approx 26 hours post campden tablets. When I opened the buckets I did see that some bubbles remained- except for the tall skinny bucket (We’ll call this “Echo Bucket” which was completely clear of bubbles, what I expected to see. 

I used D-47 yeast, hydrated with 98 degree water and yeast nutrient for 20 minutes before pitching the yeast into the buckets. I stirred in the yeast and closed the buckets with air locks. I waited 24 hours and noticed 3 of the 4 buckets were starting to bubble already- every 30 seconds or so a bubble would pass. I opened all three buckets to stir and saw that the tall skinny bucket had absolutely no bubbles in it. The best performing bucket, we’ll call it “Bravo Bucket”, has foam expelling from every place which the strainer bag was not blocking it from doing so. I stirred all buckets and re-sealed. At this point I realized that both Bravo and Echo buckets had no bubbling- shocking considering that Bravo had been the most rapidly bubbling bucket prior to my interference. I opened up Bravo and found the strainer bag had pretty much sealed the bucket around the edges, I stirred and repositioned the bag. Upon resealing Bravo again became the most rapidly bubbling airlock. 

It has now been about 40 hours since the pitching of the yeast, Alpha, Bravo and Delta buckets are pretty much non stop bubbling in the airlock, Echo is dead in the water with the only visible change being a variance of water level in the airlock, the water is being pushed down about 3/16” on the bucket side. 

Anyone have any ideas what went wrong? Do I need to re-pitch yeast in this bucket? Wondering if perhaps the strainer sack could be sealing the walls of the skinnier bucket- I did check this and it did not seem to be the case. Thanks in advance!",winemaking

Strawberry Wine Backsweetening,"I have a strawberry wine that has sat for about two months now and it’s cleared up nicely. I’m wanting to backsweeten and bottle in about a month or so and I basically have two ideas and would like some input.

The first idea, I have this Skinnygirl brand strawberry syrup made from non-fermentable sugars. My thoughts would be to basically add up to the full 750 ml of this to my 3 gallons of strawberry wine when I rack it off the sediment next and then bottle it from there.

My other thought is to get about two to three pounds of frozen strawberries and add about two cups of sugar and some pectic enzyme and them let them sit for about 24 hours. Then pour in a few cups of almost boiling water to kill off any wild yeast, let it get down to room temperature and then combine with the wine, campden tablets and potassium sorbate to stabilize it.

"Detailed resources on maceration, cap management, and color/tannin extraction?","I'm wondering whether anyone has recommendations for detailed resources on strategies to plan and manage cold soaks, punch-downs, and overall maceration times. The books I have (for example, Modern Home Winemaking by Pambianchi) are frustratingly short on details, beyond longer maceration = more color and tannin, etc.

Full story: I'm making my first wine in several years - 50% cab sav, 50% sangiovese, from Washington State grapes. 10 gallon batch fermented all together from about 145 lbs of grapes (no separation of varieties or of free run/press run). Cold soaked for 48 hours, then pitched yeast. Fermentation in stainless steel held steady in the mid-to-upper 70s, three punch downs per day, pressed at 1.010, racked off the gross lees three days later and pitched LAB at that point.

Took my first taste and critical look at it yesterday. It has fermented to dryness and clarified really nicely. My only complaint is that the color is lighter, and the tannic structure less assertive, than what I was shooting for given the cab content. It's a bright and clear ruby color, maybe tending a bit toward garnet. Tannins are subtle. The wine is balanced, and even though MLF still has a little ways to go, it's delicious and crushable. Admittedly, when I say I was ""shooting for"" a bolder more tannic wine in this case, it is more of a blind stab than anything else. The wine is definitely pleasant, but also definitely more in the mold of a light-bodied Chianti than anything that is 50% cab.

I'd love to do some more reading or YouTube watching about processes that prioritize extraction. Any books or links you know of that you care to share?",winemaking

Quickest way to make Pinot Grigio.,"Hello!

I come from beer world where I can get beer in 2 weeks after brew day, Looking into wine for the wife and from my research its looking like a MINIMUM of 2 months but more likely 3-4 months.

Is it possible to surpass a yeasts wine tolerance rating? I think I might have accidentally.,"My specific gravity before pitching was 1.150 and my ending was 1.050, both adjusted for temperature.

Recipe: Cherry Juice, loads of sugar and honey to bump up the SG, yeast nutrient, and spices. I pitched at 100 F and again once it got down to 70 F the next day. It's been going for 3 weeks now (at 70 F) and appears to be done as the airlock isn't bubbling. It tastes good, very sweet, and alcoholic, but I personally can't tell the difference between 18% and 13% abv.",winemaking

How much glycerol to fruit wine?,"

TL.DR: How much glycerol per 1L you could add to your fruit wine?

Hi, for one reason or another I don't want to stop fermentation by killing the yeast to get sweeter wine. In some cases i also don't want increase the sweetnes by reachinch alcohol tolerance by adding more and more sugar. 

for example i am urrently making mango wine with OG at 1.082 which is below yeast tolerance. I do'nt want to add sugar so it would age a bit quicker and alcohol would not overwhelm delicate mango flavor. Soo I was thinking about adding glycerol to sweeten up, but i am not sure about quantities. 

I know that human tolerance should be between 1-2g per kg of body weight. 

Also dry wines contain around 6-10g per liter. Sweet could reach 20g per liter. 

But all these are for grape wines and refered glycerol is naturally fermented. 

So, please, what is your experience with adding glycerol to fruit wines? Would 10g per liter be sufficient to reach small amount of sweetness i a dry wine? Thank you for all your inputs.",winemaking

Last years reduccant wine,"I opened a bottle of last years redcurrant wine today

https://i.imgur.com/3gUsM8Q.jpeg

My wife fell in love with these berries when she moved to my country, and planted them all over our garden. Last summer we had a bumper crop, and I made wine from them. 

When it was fresh, it was [too acidic](https://www.reddit.com/r/winemaking/comments/m8eycf/any_way_to_reduce_citric_acid_in_fruit_wine/) and had a little bit of carbonation. Even so, we drank most of it in the fall. Three bottles were saved. Now two are left.

Today, it's still a bit acidic, but it has mellowed. Apart from that it's simply good. Not just good for being home made, I'd prefer this over half the commercial grape wines I've had. The aroma has honey and berries, and reminds me of summer. Flavor is redcurrant, minerally, fresh. Good mouthfeel. The should be zero sugar left, but there's still some sweetness. Pretty magenta-red color, too.

Method/recipe:

I put a cheesecloth bag full of cleaned, washed and frozen redcurrants in a large pot, and mashed up a bit. Some of the berries were a bit under-ripe, I hoped to get some tannins from those.

SG of the berry juice was something like 1.035. I dissolved table sugar in a small amount of water, and added this sirup until SG was high enough that I expected to get just over 12% ABV after fermentation. Then put in a packet of Lalvin EC1118.

(Many fruit wine recipes call for 50% or more water, I went with as little as possible for this wine, just enough to dissolve the sugar)

First fermentation was in the pot with just a lid on. I turned and squeezed the bag occasionally. After about 10 days I removed the bag, squeezed what I could out of it, and racked the wine to secondary (a PET bottle with an airlock) It spent about a month in secondary before I bottled it. Fermentation temperature was about 21-22°C

Although I cleaned everything to avoid off flavors and gross contamination, I didn't sanitize the fruit. I figured anything that could survive 12% ABV, pH ~3 and a zillion EC1118 killer yeast cells deserved to win.

What will I do differently next time? More degassing, and I'll try to reduce the acidity before bottling.",winemaking

After the initial revulsion, subsequent nausea, and determined research into just *what that flavor is*, I came across several articles talking about brettanomyces, and how they are the bane of brewers worldwide. 

I have been able to determine that the offending yeast grows naturally on my pear trees, and due to many fantastic batches made with my figs, scuppernongs, and blueberries, I might be able to safely assume that only my pears are affected.

I am at the point of carboy aging my Hop Wine. I have had some distractions in my life lately with my father passing a few weeks ago. This has kept me from racking the wine so it has been sitting in the secondary since 10/30. All the activity has stopped so I want to rack it into a new vessel but need to add to the mass in order to remove the air gap at the top.......well, I expect there to be extra space anyway. In my one and only other wine I made it was easy since it was a Cab and so I just grabbed some Cab and added it to the carboy till it was at the bottom of the neck. With this strange concoction I don't know what to add, was thinking of a light white wine but I am still new enough not to know whites all that well. So, what would you add to this slurry of hootch? Pino Gris? Chardonnay?  Riesling? Sauvingnon Blanc?

Help with specific gravity not going down,"This is my first winemaking attempt, and I think I made some rookie mistakes.

I mashed the persimmons and mixed it with sugar water and Campden tablets on 11/15 (12 days ago) and then added the yeast on 11/16 (11 days ago). The initial specific gravity was 23 Brix.

I didn't stir it at all the first few days because I was too worried about exposure to the air ruining it. This was my big mistake, I think. I think the yeast needed that fresh air and agitation. :(

Starting on day 6, I began stirring it at least once a day, but usually 2 or 3 times per day. On 11/23 (day 7) the specific gravity was down to only 16.5 Brix. Today, 11/27 (day 11), the specific gravity is down to 10 Brix.

Most websites and instructions suggest that it only needs about 5 days of primary fermentation; some websites said up to 14. At this rate, I still have another 5+ days until the specific gravity will be down to what most people recommend (around 2-3 Brix), which will be a total of 16+ days. It looks fine ([https://imgur.com/a/RM42bnC](https://imgur.com/a/RM42bnC)), sounds fizzy and active when I open it, and smells pretty good. I feel like I have a few options:

1. Stay the course until it gets down to 2-3 Brix.
2. Stay the course but also add more yeast nutrient.
3. Go ahead and move it to secondary fermentation despite the high specific gravity.

(3) seems like a reasonable option because any sugar will still be present with the yeast in secondary, so there's no harm in moving it early? Also, it gets the wine out of the mash. But, since this is my first time, I really don't know what to do. Does anyone have any help / opinion?

How Could I Breed Yeast That Can Produce Higher Alcohol by Volume?,"Hey guys I am posting this pretty much everywhere I can think. I make ginger beer at home and I have made a ginger bug to innoculate the drink with yeast for fermentation. A ginger bug is a bit of grated ginger in some filtered water and sugar. This cultivates the wild yeast on the skin of the ginger into a robust colony which you use instead of a dry yeast packet or something similar when brewing your beer.

These wild yeast strains obviously don't produce beers with high ABV usually. Mine seems less than 2% at the highest. I have been getting into the science of evolution and natural selection and want to run a long-term experiment where I breed my own specialized strains of yeast starting with increasing ABV levels in my ginger bugs.

I assume I can simply make jars with very consistent amounts of water, sugar, and inoculant from the ""mother bug"" and then control the alcohol levels very tightly. Then move them into a slightly higher ABV may be up by 1% every so often basically just judging by eye and other sensory factors like carbonation levels as to when its time to move them up to the next higher level. I could seemingly do this with warm and cold temps? Any suggested idea would be great! I would definitely start with a bunch of small jars each a different level of ABV to find my starting highest ABV then move up from there.

Any tips or ideas on how to do this? Any good videos, links, papers, or studies on yeast and how they work and why they don't always make high abv drinks even when more sugar is added, etc. Any idea how long it would take to see improvement? Any tips on a way to measure ABV without a starting gravity? I plan to use an almost pure grain alcohol like Everclear to increase the ABV of the sugar water solution. Should I just use a sugar, water, alcohol mix or should I keep using ginger in each run?",winemaking

Will not fully diluting a kit cause any balance issues?,"I primarily make fruit wines and mead, but wanted to try out a wine kit. It’s meant to make 6 gallons at ~12.9%, but I was planning on only adding water to 5 gallons for ~15.5%. 


Higher ABV isn’t really the overall goal, more that I already have equipment for 5 gallons and don’t want to buy a larger fermentor due to space or split the batch into separate fermentors.

Not sure how to rack - and avoid oxygen - when NOT using carboys ...,"Avoiding oxygen while racking seems easy going carboy to carboy - you can dump argon or CO2 into the donor and you can totally fill the receiver carboy with it ... and the mouth of the carboy is not much larger than your tubing.  It seems very manageable.

But if I have stainless steel fermenters and I am racking from one ""big can"" to another, it's not clear to me how I could possibly avoid a lot of oxygen content ... the containers I refer to are these:

&amp;#x200B;

(Chapman Stainless 14 gallon fermenter - portless)

&amp;#x200B;

I basically have the entire surface area of the container exposed in \*BOTH\* donor and receiver for the length of the siphon time.  I could TRY to pour in gas over the top but I don't think it will stay put ... and siphoning isn't exactly fast ... 

With that in mind, I feel like I am just as well taking a half gallon pot and doing a very quick transfer and then immediately clearing the headspace with argon and sealing.  I can probably do this in about 60 seconds as opposed to ... who knows how long having both containers open and running the siphon.

Also racked two wines to secondary: a grape wine which is in WAY too big a carboy for it, but it's a cheap frozen-grape-concentrate wine so if it tastes terrible I can shrug it off as a learning experience. And an apple-cranberry fruit wine I'm pretty excited about.

Oak Barrel Schedule," I’ve been a (grape) home wine maker for 7 years. Every year, I put my wine in non-permeable stainless steel kegs and leave it there for the next 12 months. I rack it 2-3 times to clean the lees of the bottom. And then I bottle it, right before the next harvest. This is pretty standard stuff, I imagine many many others adhere to a similar protocol.

I’m looking to upgrade my winemaking, and age in an oak barrel. Of course, everybody knows, you’ll get better quality aging in oak, rather than the non-permeable steel; you get the oak flavor that gets imparted, but you also get the microoxidation, which really cannot be replicated in steel (or glass). My question: what is an appropriate schedule for oak barrel usage in the next few years?

As a home winemaker, I have restrictions that the big wineries do not. I can’t have a fleet of new and neutral barrels, shuffling wine around as the taste permits. And, I know that once you have a barrel, it’s optimal to keep it full of liquid all the time. I’ll have one 60 gallon barrel, and once the wine is in there, it’s pretty much stuck there until I have something next year to replace it.

Now (November) I think would be a bad time to put the recent harvest’s wine in a new barrel. I’ll have no new wine for 11 months (next October), and wine in a new barrel for 11 months would be waaaaay over oaked (I think???). So I think I let it sit in my stainless steel kegs for a few months, then move it to a barrel so that it won’t be over oaked by the time I’m able to replace it. But if I replace it in October 2022, can that wine be in the barrel for 12 months until the next harvest, or is 12 months in a “second run” barrel too much? Etc etc etc.

So I’m looking for some advice: Year 1 put wine in a new barrel for X months. Year 2 put wine in that barrel for Y months. Year 3 put wine in that barrel for Z months. Etc etc etc. Can somebody offer guidance here? (And yes, this is for a full sized 60 gallon wine barrel).

Need general advise from wine makers,"I'm just looking for general advice. I've played around a bit with Prison Hooches and gotten a good result from Ocean Spray's Cran-Tropic juice but it's clearly a hooch. I tried my hand at cider and that keeps coming out cloudy and pretty unflavorful in general. I have made a few meads and they have been okay but nothing special. I have made a few wines from juice concentrate as well and these have come out the best of all so far.

A little more info. 2 weeks ago I was home on the weekend for the first time in a long time. I thought this would be a good time to make my first 5 gallon batch of fruit wine. I used 18 lbs. of frozen strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries along with 12 lbs. of sugar, 1 packet of K1-V1116, GoFermPE and pectic enzyme to treat 5 gallons. I followed a Tonsa 2.0 yeast nutrient schedule with FermO and FermK. Starting gravity was 1.090 and 10 days later it clocked in at 1.000. I racked 5 gallons of wine out of the 6 gallon bucket and left the solids behind. For the last week or so this has been sitting in my secondary carboy and slowly bubbling. I should mention that when I racked (because this was already at 1.000) I added enough potassium sorbate to dose all 5 gallons. I think the little bit of bubbling I am getting is from the remaining yeast slowly eating the last of the sugars in the carboy. I have not added any fining agents or potassium metabisulfite yet. 

The day I was mixing this all up in primary, my wife called and told me her grandfather had just passed away. My goal is to take my time with this 5 gallons and make it really nice and give it out to the family next year on veterans day as he was a veteran. The family likes sweeter wines, their favorite is the Olive Garden favorite: Roscato. That is just for reference.

It hit me that the Roscato is sparkling and since I already dosed the 5 gallons with K-Sorbate, I am not going to get a sparkling wine out of this. But I am looking for advise as to what to do to get the best wine I can out of this. There is a lot of fruit pectins and yeast settling in the carboy, already about 1"" worth so I plan to rack this again tomorrow when I am home so that gunk is removed. I will then sanitize the carboy and return the wine to that container.

I think right now I am going to plan to let this sit for another month and take a few samples along the way to ensure the gravity stops moving. When I get the final gravity, should I stabilize again or just move right into backsweetening and hit it with the Potassium Sulfite a few days later? Beyond that, should I let this settle out and clear naturally or should I use a 2-part fining agent? I don't want to hooch it and use gelatin... and I am reluctant to use bentonite that late in the game as I am afraid that it may strip some flavors or color. Also, what would be the best way to backsweeten this berry wine, Karo, table sugar, or wildflower honey? I guess I could experiment with some samples but I would prefer to hear some advise from the more experienced brewers out there.",winemaking

What Changes During Aging?,"Hi All!

First time making wine and I'm trying to figure out what to expect to change during the aging process.  

I'm using Pinot Noir grapes from Willamette Valley.  Primary fermentation went well, malolactic went well.  After malo, I tasted a little and it was pretty harsh and the alcohol really hit you more than anything else.  I racked it, added a little SO2, and let it sit in bulk for about two months.  Last week I racked it again and just tasted it today.  

The clarity is good.  The color intensity isn't great but for Pinot it's not terrible.  The aroma is pretty faint and floral.  The taste definitely has cherries but it's not complex at all and has almost no finish.  So I let it sit in the glass for 20 minutes to see how it would change with oxygen and tried it again.  It had gone nearly completely flat in that short time and had really lost a lot of the flavor.  

So the question is: As it continues to age, can I expect it to get better?  Or is this lot just probably not going to be that great?  Are there any active interventions I can take to make the wine more complex at this point?

Thanks for any advice or knowledge!",winemaking
Backsweetening homemade grape wine and fruit wine,"Hi Team,

I've been making wine at home for three years, but I still call myself a beginner. I'm just now figuring out some basic winemaking principles. I haven't tried backsweetening my wines before, and I get a lot of comments that they're too dry.

I've read articles and watched videos about different methods to sweeten wine, and I heard a method described as ""step sweetening"" that I'm curious about. Basically, you add sugar in stages after secondary fermentation is complete until the ABV is high enough that the yeast can't survive to ferment the newly added sugar.

Here's what I understand of the process:

\- 1. Rack and rerack the wine until it's as clear as possible

\- 2. Add a measure of simple syrup

\- 3. Let the wine go for a week or two and watch for signs of fermentation/changes in hydro readings

\- 4. Repeat 2 &amp; 3 until there are no signs of fermentation and the wine tastes good

\- 5. Bottle it up

Do I understand this properly? Have any of you done this, and how would you compare it to using sulfites and sulfates?

Here's the recipe I've followed for these wines:Grape wine (5 gallons)- 10 gallons of grapes from my backyard vine- Wild ferment - I just crushed them and let them ferment on their own- Added a magnum of Moscato when I started secondary ferment to eliminate head space in the carboy

Peach wine (5 gallons)- 20 lbs peaches- 6 lbs sugar- black tea for tannins- 1/2 cup raisins- 2 gallons of water- D47 yeast

CO2 to protect from oxidation,"I have my first batch of red wine fermenting right now. Once its done, could I use some CO2 the same way as one of those argon preservative cans to preserve the wine in an opened bottle? Just spraying some in to make a protective blanket before corking back up? I have a bunch of CO2 for inflating bike tires and would rather not order argon cans if I don't need to.

Cider is more of my thing, and I really just use grape wine for cooking, so I don't go through bottles very fast. Really, if I'm just cooking with it, will I even notice oxidation over the period of a month or two/ does preserving with gas matter? I know cooking wines from the grocery store don't need the gas to protect them, but they are also salty beyond the dead sea and I don't like using that stuff in my food.

What can I do with this ridiculous 15.5 ABV Pinot Noir ?,"For the record, we tested a very representative sample of the vineyard and harvested at 23.5 BRIX so I really have no idea how we got to 15.5% alcohol ... 

We just finished M-L and lab results say we are at:

\- ph 3.9

\- ABV 15.5%

\- TA 5.0 g/L

\- Residual Sugar 0.0

So we are double dry (sugar and malo) and we need to adjust ph downward with tartaric acid and then sulfur - probably to 60 ppm.

So ...

If we're shooting for normal california pinot noir, and 15.5% abv is a given, should we err on the side of more acidic (lower ph) or try to keep it less acidic (higher ph) ?

Other than watering down the wine, I don't know of any other knobs I can turn here - only the choice of acidity to adjust to ...

Is there a way to check on the progression of the aging?,"After active fermentation, the wine is aging. How can i tell if/how it is progressing? I mean, it's just in bottles in the basement.

Why is the water level in this S airlock lower on the side exposed to the air?,"I have a basic question here. When using an airlock, fermentation causes the gas to go through the water, and you can even watch it go through when it is active. I assume that when it is slow, you can even see the gas displace the water, which is why the water levels can be uneven in an S airlock. That is, the gas is pushing the water down until it breaks surface tension or gets past the bend, and finally releases. In that case, the water level will be lower in the side connected to the wine, and higher on the side expose to the air. Is that correct?

*If* that is correct, how does the opposite happen? That is, where the water level is lower in the side exposed to the air. I took [a picture](https://i.imgur.com/pvmGX8o.jpg) of it, though looking at it now, it is not so obvious to see. In any case, the water level is at the max line on the side exposed to the wine and not really above the bend in the side exposed to the air. How does that happen? I'm really curious to know. I mean, to *understand*.",winemaking

"Newbie question about Yeast, Sugar and Alcohol","Hello.  


I'm starting to make my first batch of wine and i'm doing my readings and i have a wine that the Alcohol % is very low.

  
My question is: **If i want to make a new batch and want to increase the Alcohol % what i have to do?**

* Increase yeast? i used 1/4 teaspoon
* Increase the sugar of the recipe? I made a total of 2 recipes one is coffee wine that have a lower alcohol % and the other was Banana wine that have higher percentage of alcohol.

Banana wine recipe have more sugar but the same yeast as coffee wine.   
I only make one racking and since the coffee wine have so low sugar the readings should be bone dry but it didn't and in first week the banana wine was much more active than the coffee wine.  


Banana wine is almost 10% alcohol in first week

Coffee wine as like 4% alcohol in first week.

Feeling very skeptical about this cranberry apple wine.,"Hi all. I'm pretty inexperienced with winemaking and this does not look right to me. My concern is the amount of fruit that's sticking out. I used a rubber spatula to get the cranberry bits off the walls of the bucket but this still seems like a crazy mold growth waiting to happen. Some of that apple is barely touching the water. Here's the recipe I followed:  


 • 7-8 lbs. sour or cooking apples   
• 2 1/2 lbs. cranberries   
• 1 1/2 lbs. finely granulated sugar   
• 1/2 tsp. pectic enzyme   
• 1/2 tsp. citric acid   
• 1 gallon water   
• 1 tsp. yeast nutrient   
• 1 pkt Champagne wine yeast   


Can anyone tell me if this is abnormal? Is there just way too much fruit in this recipe? Something else going on?

Pinot Noir taste test immediately after malo finished ... not good.,"So ... we pressed off the skins when primary fermentation was done (lab analysis confirms we are at 0.06 g/L of residual sugar ... bone dry).

We tasted the wine as we pressed it off the skins and it was definitely not finished, professional wine ... but it also wasn't bad.  It was yummy and there was a taste of grape fruit and so on.

So then we did Malo ... and I think it just finished ... and it just tastes like ass.

I don't really taste any fruit.  It's got a strong alcohol taste with nothing to balance it.

I don't have an experienced enough vocabulary or palate to say much more ... 

My mouth is not puckering a lot so I don't know if astringent is the right word ...

So did we blow it somehow?  Or does 14.x ABV pinot straight off of malo-lactic ferm taste pretty rough normally ?

Anyone want to share boneheaded mistakes? I just realized a silly mistake I've been making for years!,"I don't use chitosan and kieselsol often, so I've only made this mistake a couple of times over the years. I  usually add it as a last resort when my wine won't clear up, after cold stabilization and using bentonite with little success in my white wine. 

It worked great in small batches, but when I sized up to 100L batches, these fining agents tended to make my wine even cloudier!

I realized this week, after extensive troubleshooting with two large batches, that when converting my dosages, I'd been converting the unit HL to 10L, instead of 100L. This means I'd been adding 10x the amount of chitosan and kielselsol, and explains the excessive haze perfectly, it's protein haze!

It didn't turn out to be a big deal, as protein haze is easily removed with bentonite, but boy did that make me feel silly. Also, chitosan can be expensive.

To make it worse, I'm and engineer in real life, and do these conversions every day. Sometimes you just have to read something 101 times for it to make sense!

**Anyone else care to share a boneheaded mistake made recently? Let's commiserate!**

Possible foreign yeast infection on wine during sur lie aging - what steps are recommended?,"First and foremost, I've caught it early, so it's not too late. I did a taste test and found no off flavours either.

My plum wine has been aging on the lees for 3 weeks. I can see a few small strains stuck to the sides of the neck of the carboy at 1.5-2cm length, thin as a hair. This can either be yeast that has previously been dormant and now activated post fermentation due to residual yeast nutrients (had issues with nutrient deficiency the latter half of primary). Or it's foreign yeast from other brews that may have gotten in during batonnage as I don't have much space, or just airborne yeast.

**Anyway**, I understand I need to add some extra sulphites as well as potassium sorbate, but can I add potassium sorbate during lees aging, or will the lees absorb it before it reaches the infection yeast? Will I need to rack off the lees and discard it first? Will there be any potential off flavours from adding potassium sorbate this early? The wine will age for another 9 months or so, with 2-3 months on the lees initially planned.

It tastes a bit boring although it's pretty smooth.

Hop Wine,"Hey everyone,  
So this is my first time posting here and I am a pretty new member of the community. A little back story, homebrewed beer for many years (15 or so) many years ago (10 or so) and fell into home winemaking during this pandemic thing we are in. Got a batch of kit Cab under my belt and it turned out fan-freakin-tastic and was looking for something new. Well my dad gave me 3 ""food saver"" bags of random hops he picked on a walk and wanted me to do something with them. So my Google-Fu found the recipe below and thought WTH, might as well try it. Turns out he picked enough for 5 gallons so I ended up making the full 5 gallons, probably going to turn out like Prison Hooch but what the hell right? I put it together Sunday afternoon and pitched the yeast on Monday morning, it's going strong in the primary as we speak...............just wanted to share.  


----Hop Wine-----  
3oz Hops  
1oz Ginger (Bruised)  
1 UK Gal (4.5Ltr) Water  
8oz Raisins (Chopped)  
2.5lb Sugar  
2tsp Citric Acid  
Yeast and Nutrient   


 Bring water to the boil, add hops and ginger and simmer for an hour. Strain the hot liquid onto the raisins and sugar, stir until the sugar dissolves. Leave to cool. Add the citric acid, yeast and nutrient. After about 5 days rack it off the raisins. Standard 'ferment out, add campden and rack til clear' instructions after that. Recommends not drinking it until 6 to 9 months after bottling.   


Amount: 5 gallons  
Original Gravity: 1.110  
Estimated ABV: 14.438%

Forgot to rack,"So I'm not a fancy man. I know how to make jailhouse booze from when I was too young to buy alcohol. I learned a lot back then but gave it up the minute someone in my crew turned 21.

I got one of those brewsy kits - yeast + sugar + juice = wine. I was following a recipe and after a few days they have you cold crash it to kill the extra yeast. Then they want you to rack it like 48 hours later.

Well, I screwed up and forgot about it for like 5 days or more.

Will putting them in a refrigerated climate kill most if not all the yeast? I think the point was to stop it from continuing to ferment so some flavor was left. I am hopeful all I've done is allow the yeast to settle and clear up a bit more (rather than racking 4 times, maybe just 3 now since I let it go so long?). Is the dead yeast killing the taste right now?

Sorry for the obnoxious super newbie question. I very much respect your hobby and I know these kits are a mockery of the real thing. I just don't have the time or space for another serious hobby. Thank you very much.",winemaking

Possible re-fermentation after back sweetening.,"I figured the wine was done fermenting after 4 days at 0.995 and no bubbles those 4 days.

What siphon/pump should we use to rack?,"While my wife has been making wine with relatives for years, this is my first time joining in the process. She knows what needs to be done, but not always why or when is best, so i figured i ought to read up on it.

We're making three wines this year: Zinfandel, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, with the latter as a long-term project. The grapes were pressed and let to set for 1-1.5 weeks, and put into carboys about two weeks ago. She said they usually leave them for active fermentation in the garbage cans and bottle them later, but the fruit flies seemed to be getting out of hand. Now they seem to like dying in the airlocks, especially in the merlot. We've been changing the airlocks every week.

I'm told we need to rack. From what i've read, we should have done the first racking a couple weeks ago. Until now, i had thought it was done much later in the process. I am so ignorant of this process.

Anyway, she usually racks siphoning the old-fashioned way. I see there are other ways, with an auto-siphon or a pump. I'm wondering which is best to use.

Currently, we have 4 5-gallon carboys with the merlot, the fourth being a little less full than the other two (maybe 4 gallons?). The cabernet is a 5 and 2 one-gallons. The zinfandel is 4 carboys.

What would you recommend we use to rack? Explanations are especially welcome! I want to learn.",winemaking
First time (and first mistake!),"Howdy!

Mostly just wanted to say hi to the community.  I've been practicing my wine tasting for a little while now (still a beginner -- just reading lots of blogs and labels, and asking lots of questions), and I jumped into my first ~~home~~ apartment wine making attempt (with a juice and yeast kit) a week from yesterday.  Looking forward to continuing to get into my new-ish hobby, and getting to know the community!

Incidentally, at about exactly the halfway point through letting the yeast do its thing for two weeks (i.e. yesterday), I noticed some fruit flies had sadly passed away in the fermentation stopper thing with the water in it (still learning my technical terms, clearly %-)  I decided to pull the stopper out, clear it, rinse it, re-fill it halfway again with water, and replace it as quickly as possible.  Is my first attempt already doomed?  Did I handle this the right way, given the circumstances?

Any any case, howdy and nice to meet you all!

Grape Varietal and Growing Conditions in relation to Turbidity and Sediment,"Hey there! I currently work in the beverage industry and we are working on a project that relates to our products, sediment, and clarity. We originally though that a higher initial NTU was indicative of a higher potential for sediment to fall out of solution. With the addition of enzymes and testing many different filtration methods (we are selling a Koch Membrane Filter Unit if any of you producers out there are interested) we are starting to think that may not be the case. My question for you all is this, are their wines you expect to have more clarity than others, and is this purely indicative of filtration or do varietal and growing circumstances play a role in final product clarity? Would a grape grown in high elevation and more mineral driven areas have a hazier look than something grown elsewhere in much different conditions? 

Would love to hear what you all have to say about this!",winemaking
Going (semi) Pro - advice needed,"Howdy guys, I missed this year's harvest, but I am looking to up my game for next year. I have an underground garage that is 42m2 (452 sqft) and 2.5m high, and I plan to transform it into a micro winery. 

I am used to doing 500kg (300L finished wine) batches, but I am looking to up this to a total of roughly 2800L wine (8 barrels + 1000L ss tank)

I am planning and budgeting at the moment, and I would appreciate if you can help a brother out with some insights :

1. Between a fixed volume and a variable volume SS tank (used for for primary, MLF and storage), which would you prefer? Looking at Letina Professional tanks
2. Do I need chiller AND heater, or running MLF can be done with ambient temperature. I am looking at Kreyer Max chilly 50
3. Has anybody have experience with using a chiller for room temp control too?
4. I am looking at Moog for barrel cleaning without moving, but what is the best pressure washer for it?
5. I have a polished concrete floor, is there anything that I have to do to protect it?
6. Is it ok to ferment in plastic bins and then run MLF in SS, or would you just run MLF in barrel and call it a day?
7. Hoses and fittings - I am looking at DIN32 as a standard fitting for liquid transfer, is this ok?
8. Tri clamps- would you say they arethe right choice?
9. Is Spidel 90 or 180L hydropresse adequate for the volumes I plan.
10. Is fermentor's automation worth it - HELI sprinklers and a pump
11. What is the best pump to get that won't break the bank?
12. I plan to install a professional ventilation, but is there anything specific that I should be aware?

"Mango Wine/Cider has a distinctly sour/vinegar aroma, advice? Mash the pulp?","I basically want a mango cider, like instead of apples, mangoes


Recipe:
3 keitt mangoes; roughly 3 1/2 lbs of actual fruit, peeled and de-seeded- blended in vitamix
2 cups of sugar
2 tsp Mangrove Jacks cider yeast - used this previously, had nice crisp taste and included yeast nutrient 
1/2 tsp of pectic enzyme
Water to fill-ish 1 gallon jug
(No campden tablets out of hubris/cheapness)

Sterilized jug; airlock; hydrometer and beeker. 

Blitzed sliced, peeled mangoes with water; added sugar; yeast and pectic enzyme shook whole thing ( not enough shaking to dissolve all the sugar out of laziness) put in basement. 


I attempted to get a hydrometer reading but the musk was far too thick.

I came back the next day solids had moved to top, but there was no apparent movement.

At around 36 hours I came back and the pulp had pushed its way into the airlock. Sterilized a new airlock and degassing stick to punch pulp down and replaced the airlock. I punched down  the pulp at the top 6-7 more times with a sterilized spoon or rod every 18 hours or so. now at around 10 days the pulp is at the bottom and the top is almost clear- but there is a definitively sour smell coming out of this airlock. 

Basically, what do you guys think the smell is? Did I make vinegar by mistake?

Second point, how should I get rid of the pulp? I was finally able to procure some cheese cloth (store was out last time) i have a fine strainer- any reason to not just cheese cloth it out before 2nd racking?

I plan on re-racking soon and then back sweetening it into beer bottles and then pasteurizing it using my sousvide machine. 

Any advice is much appreciated!

first time fruit wine questions,"I followed a recipe for strawberry wine found online, very basic: 3lb fruit, 2-3lb sugar(I used 3), packaged yeast (red star premiere Blanc), and a gallon of water(used distilled). Also did the same recipe for a pineapple must.

I never took a gravity reading in the beginning. Beginner mistake because I was waffling between going old school or using measurable science. Primary fermentation was done open-ish in an old(washed then sanitized with starSan) cheese puff jar with cheesecloth over top and the lid not fully snapped down. Punched down 2x daily for just over a week. I reracked into carlo rossi carboys one full of strawberry, one full of pineapple, a bonus one of the remainder of both mixed together. Everything looking perfect at that point, airlocks bubbling, precipitate settling, after a month or so I rerack to freshly sanitized carboys to get wine off settled solids, and it sits for probably two months still bubbling away. 

Bubbling slows, gravity reading at this point does nothing because there's nothing to compare to so I figure my best option is max out the yeast. The strawberry and the mix batch are still going enough to know there's life if it, this rerack all three get another pound of sugar made into simple syrup, and the plain pineapple gets a few white raisins tossed in. A month later one final switch to sanitized carboys and plans to bottle eventually.

That was six months ago. My one year old was hospitalized and life at our new place has gotten ahead of me. There's zero sediment in these carboys, the strawberry sends a bubble up the airlock about every other day but the mix and the pineapple seem still. Am I done, should I add more sugar? I love a dessert wine :) 

It's been near a year since I started the must. When do I drink some and can it stay in the carboy as long as the airlocks haven't dried? Should I just fortify it to ease my paranoia of having made poison, six months later is too late right? It tasted fair but a little sharp(blame my open fermentation) when I last switched it, it's been sitting airlocked on the kitchen counter(center of house no windows) collecting dust for six months.",winemaking
Protecting carboys from cracks and breakage,"I've heard that some brands of carboys have been having problems with cracking.

How much oxygen is too much oxygen ? (airlock bubbling backwards due to atmospheric pressure),"Pressed off the skins today and filled 7 gallon stainless steel vessels.

Filled them about 1.5"" from the top.  So 1.5"" of headspace for 7 gallons.  Seemed reasonable.

I poured CO2 into the headspace then put on the S-lock airlocks filled with everclear.

It was about to rain and even started to rain as we closed them up.

***A few hours later ...***

I come back and the everclear is ""pushed"" all the way over to the wine side of the airlock and every 3-5 minutes a few bubbles go through *from the outside.*

The airlock is running in reverse - I am bubbling into the wine.

I suspect that the weather got a bit better, clouds went away, and atmospheric pressure went up since we sealed the airlocks.  Temperature has not really changed so I don't think that's it.

So the good news is, I'm airtight for sure - since I am holding a non-level airlock.

But the bad news is, I'm bringing in oxygen continuously - a few bubbles ever 3-5 minutes.

***Should I care ?***

I poured in a blanket of CO2 so the outside air should be lighter and stay in the top, right ?

ALSO, fermentation is over but it just ended yesterday so I have very young wine just pressed off the skins - I think oxygen contact is not that big of a deal right now ?  

Maybe even desirable ?

I don't know how to think about bubbles every 3-5 minutes and 1.5 inches of headspace on a bucket ...

Mold in my first small batch of wine,"Hi. First timer here and I am seeking some advjce after getting mold in my must. 
We got a lot of grapes from the garden this year. Wanted to give winemaking a try. Followed a recipe from a youtuber called cuoredicioccolato, which explained how to make wine without adding yeast, so using only the natural, wild yeast from the skin. After speaking to the cashier in a local home brew-store I was adviced to wait for 3days to see if the wild yeast would start fermentation, if not adding a mead-yeast the sold. 
The grapes where frozen and still quite cold when I pressed them to must. I therefore waited another 2 days seeing that it took almost 2 days for the must to reach desired temperature. I was disappointed to see that the yeast gad not started and when opening the lid to add the mead-yeast I saw that the must had developed a moldy layer. Now I am uncertain on wetter I need to throw it all away or if there would be sufficient to scrape away the mold and add the yeast?
Also very eager to learn why this happened and what I can do to prevent it the next time.",winemaking

I decided to try to make a small batch of Welch's Concord. I had three gallons in a five gallon carboy, 2lb of sugar, and a packet of Mangrove Jack's VR21.

My temperature corrected OG was 1.107. It took about 24 hours for fermentation to start, but once it did it was pretty active. My garage was 74-78 F.

Fermentation slowed down two days ago and looks like it stopped (so far as bubbles/foam moving around) today. I racked it out of primary and into three one gallon carboys. Took another SG reading tonight and it seems to be dead on 1.0. I tasted a sample and you can definitely smell/taste alcohol. It's still pretty opaque.

I took a taste and it's not what you'd say great. But it was also really warm. I'm planning on backsweetening it before it goes into bottles. My questions are, how long should I let it sit in secondary and should I put in some bentonite to have it clear up some more?

I'm assuming the next steps will be potassium sorbate and then backsweetening before I put it into bottles?",winemaking

A question on sanitization and wine making vs beer making.,"I come from the beer making world of hobbies and one thing I have noticed in literature and common practice is that beer making focuses on the extreme end of sanitation vs wine seems a bit less so. Example being that beer folks tend to view especially the beginning phase of fermentation being super risky. Don't lift the lid to check how it's going, don't fart near the wort, oh you are a surgeon.. you better scrub harder. But wine making seems to almost be the opposite. Crush the grapes with your feet, wash your hands and punch down the cap etc. Not to say sanitation of equipment isn't different a d they certainly advise washing heavily.  

The question I ha e is this just a cultural thing or is there some science behind this? Is it the acidity of the juice vs wort? Is it the less focus on one yeast?",winemaking

I pulled another bottle at 25 days and the heat has reduced to relatively sane levels, but the original flavour seems to have been muted even further as well.

I followed a pretty basic recipe that was rather vague on its steps.  Around 1 month I understand that I should rerack and let it settle out, but how much more can I expect the flavour to change?  How much of aging in a recipe like this is flavour vs clarity?

Stranger fermentations - yeast failure?,"So, I am currently in the process of making my first wine (Moscato/Muscat) and it appears something rather unusual is happening in the fermentation stage.

As I'm writing this, the must is bubbling away like one of those little aquarium volcanos. The weird thing is that it has been doing this for more than two weeks now, and I've been told repeatedly that it should have finished closer to one week after the start of fermentation.
I took a sample for analysis and it's at 8.15% alcohol and 58g/l sugar, meaning that it still has a fair way to go. Also, it has somehow undergone full malolactic fermentation, further suggesting that the yeast is underperforming. 

All this seems at odds with the observed frenetic activity of the must. The suggestion was to add nutrients to boost the fermentation, but does anyone have any ideas as to what might actually be going on, or causing this?

Some more details that might help solve the case:
The fermentation vessels are glass demijohns, one of 50L and 2x20L. Cellar temperature is approx. 19°C. Pressing was done immediately after harvest and quite lightly so as not to extract too much pectin from the skins. The must was sterilized with bisulphites and left 24hrs before enoculation with a white wine yeast, which I mixed with a cup of lukewarm water prior to adding to the demijohns.",winemaking

Making some hard apple cider which is in primary. By my calculations, I should have about 3.75 gallons to move to secondary (after calculating loss to lees) - and I planning on using a 3 gal carboy.

I just started a small batch of blueberry wine (just added campden and enzymes) and will have about a quarter gallon that won't fit my container. 

Would it work when moving the apple cider into seconday then add \~quarter gallon the blueberry juice?  I am thinking the existing yeast from the apple cider could ferment the blueberry juice. I would have to rerack sooner, but that isn't a problem.  

Anyone try this before?",winemaking

Seriously confused,"So about 6 months ago I made a 5 gal batch of blueberry wine. Took great care, followed a proven reciepe to the letter. ABV came out around 14%, great color and great flavor. I left it in the carboy longer than normal because my wine shop was out of bottles and honestly my wine rack is overflowing. Then my son was put in the hospital, I changed jobs, life got crazy for a few months. Tonight I went in to grab a few bottles and I noticed the bubbler was dry (I have not clie for how long) and there was a strong smell of vinegar in the room. Pissed, I took the carboy out, pulled about 100 ml into a glass. It smelled strong of alcohol, like a cheap bottle of wine, but defiantly not like vinegar. There was no mold, or fuzz. So I tasted it. It tasted flat, like dry koolaid with a kick but not undrinkable. I refilled the bubble, put it back on and to my suprised it pressurized almost immediately. My wife thinks I should throw it out. But im thinking I could sneak it into the rotation at a bbq or bonfire, after every ones been drinking and get a little bang for my buck.

Can’t seem to wild ferment grapes properly.,"Hi
This is my first time trying to ferment grapes on their own without any kind of external yeast added due to the fact that i can’t find wine yeast/brewing yeast where i live. 
I crushed about 5kgs of red grapes a week ago and put them in my fermenter. 3 days in or so, i didn’t notice any CO2 escaping so i had to visually examine the brew. I found these really small white dots that seem to be mold. 
I have narrowed it down to 3 possible aspects: 
1- i didn’t sanitize everything quite well
2- the grapes themselves don’t have enough yeast in them
3- the temp is too cold right now (15-23C) throughout the day

(Follow Up) I have found a way to ferment Alulose(in theory),"This is a follow-up to my last post so let me just quickly recap: Alulose is a type of sugar really similar to fructose(the sugar found in fruits, agave, etc) in chemical structure, yet it tastes completely different. In my last post, I have asked if it is possible to ferment alulose into alcohol and how that could open a whole new world of flavors that could be added to your wine. The members of this community said that it cannot be fermented by yeast and it is only used for sweetening the wine. However, I think that I know a theoretical way to ferment Alulose however it is only hypothetical and far from easy. Scientists have been able to evolve an E.coli bacteria to be able to consume citrate(I will detail the exact procedure they took to get there in a comment below this post, but it is essentially evolving a new species of bacteria within lab conditions). I had thought if we can do the same with yeast to make it evolve to be able to digest Alulose or citrate or any carbohydrate really.  And I think it should be possible however there is one big limitation. If you are the one to develop it, only you can use it, there is no safe or efficient way to distribute it to everyone else unless of course, you are able to open your own yeast company. I am also by no means a microbiologist so everything I say is just speculation. If anyone knows more about this topic than I do, I would love to hear what you have to say.",winemaking

Q1. Do I need to add in more sugar for the second fermentation? 

Q2. Should I still fill the carboy to only the shoulder or should I fill it to 1’’ from the airlock since so much sugar has been removed.

Rosé grape wine bottled!,"Just bottled by first decently successful winemaking project! Got these two 75cl bottles, plus about 10oz of spare wine (now in my fridge for casual tasting). 

This wine ended up being a perfect recipe for a STRONG bubblegum smell. I read about bubblegum flavor in wine and found that it’s normally a product of carbonic maceration, a process that eats up malic acid. This makes sense - I added tartaric and citric acid to this but neglected to add malic acid, so it pushed the fruitiness in the same direction I think. Palate is astringent and slightly hot as it is very young, but good grapefruit/lemon flavor and maybe a bit of a tannin/mineral character which I hope reveals itself more with plenty of age.

After that, I added potassium metabisulfite to it. This is when things went unexpected... the whole thing turned brown within few minutes while I was preparing yeast. I thought the whole thing is lost at that time. However, I told myself yep add that yeast and see what happens (added just a bit barely a quarter of the dose required for alcohol fermentation). Luckily it at least seemingly recovered after few hours and currently (24 hours from cruising) is of very very saturated dark red bit purplish color (sweet in taste).

Is the KMBS really that strong and fast ? Hard to believe it works its way through all the grapes and skins ...,"Pinot noir crushed and put into stainless primary fermenters today.  10 gallons each.

Although it is not absolutely necessary, I am indeed going to add 50ppm of sulfur with KMBS for good measure - and to kill off wild yeast strains, etc.  I will wait 10-12 hours and then pitch the yeast.

But in practice, it is hard to believe this even works:

the calculation for 50ppm in 10 gallons comes out to 3.3 grams - which is just over 1/2 teaspoon ... 1/2 teaspoon in 10 gallons.

And it's not just 10 gallons of liquid - it's 10 gallons of skins and seeds and ...

I layered it in as we filled the containers *and* I mixed up the final 10 gallons a bit to mix it around ... it's just really hard to believe that 1/2 tsp of powder doesn't just get lodged in some grape skins somewhere and just get stuck there.

So, it's really going to dissolve, evenly, throughout all those skins and seeds and (the juice) and do it's work in 10-12 hours before I pitch the yeast ?",winemaking

Ideas for balancing acidity in sour plum wine,"Howdy folks!

I have ~8 gals of sour plum wine that has just hit the 3 month age mark. I did 7 days on the skins and pits. And have been slow fermenting @65F ambient w/ a saison yeast. ABV ~10%. PH 3.55. I didn't bother taking a TA measurement, but lets assume it is high...

I'm really happy with the flavors and color, and the tannins have mellowed nicely already. It is, however, quite acidic. Kind of par for the course with this fruit, but ya, I'm looking for ideas for balancing things out.

I'll keep a couple gallons as is, maybe even bottle carb it - sort of a sparkling umeboshi drink. Not a quaffing beverage, but interesting and delicious in small quantities. The nose is amazing. I think a sour stomach will be a risk of multiple servings.

I'm going to take a couple gallons and mix with apple cider I'm making this year. That should be interesting and depending on how my cider turns out could be complimentary.

I could try to back sweeten some. But I don't like the taste of the non-fermentable sweeteners, and I'm not into pasteurizing.

I could try to do some MLF and smooth things out some. I've pitched a little sulfur for aging already though, so this might be fruitless.

Finally, I could sweeten and keg and refrigerate. Puts me on a timer... but maybe still my favorite option.

Any favorites from the crowd? Any options I'm not considering? I have a 1 gal keg I can refrigerate, a 5 gal corny key I can't refrigerate, 5 and 8 gal carboys, and champagne bottles. Open to ideas.

"I made my first batches of wine last year - one was good, the other was awful... Any tips for this year?","As per title.

I made two batches - a plum and gooseberry wine, where I added both hot water and brewing sugar to the smooshed fruit, fermented in a muslin bag, and then pressed the juice out. The wine turned out nice, if a touch dry... stabilised with potassium sulfate and backsweetened, and it was all good!

Second batch was with grapes from my parents garden. No added water or sugar to this batch, just crushed grapes. Added the yeast on top of the crushed fruit, but either left it too long *or* wasn't attentive to batch hygiene, as I ended up with about 5 L of vinegar..

I've got the grape harvest from my parents garden again. By the time it got to me (a few days after picking), the grapes smelled *distinctly* vinegary in the bucket they were transported in... I sifted through, removed the rotten/damaged fruit, and picked the good grapes from stalks. The good fruit got a quick wash in cold-water with a campden tablet, and then bunged into the freezer as I wasn't ready to start the wine.

So, any general tips for this year?

My plan is:

1. Buy the supplies I'm missing (just wine yeast for now, gonna get a wholegrain beer kit too to get the Christmas brew started!).
2. Defrost and crush the grapes in a sterile bucket - Worth doing in a muslin bag?
3. Measure sugar level with hydrometer - adjust to 1.070 - 1.100 with brewing sugar or water as required.
4. Measure pH (got a ready supply of strips at work) - adjust to pH 3.1-3.4 with acid if needed (I have citric and tannic I think?)
5. Add pectolase
6. Add yeast, then loose fitting lid over the bucket.
7. Punch down daily for 2 weeks - be careful to wash hands/equipment well between punchings.
8. Strain off the fruit - I have a fruit press too, so maybe squeeze out the rest of the juice from the pomace at this point?
9. Decant into demijohns with airlocks - leave until the wine clarifies, or for a few months?
10. Stabilise with campden tablet or potassium sulfate, then bottle.

I also have some part A and B finings, not sure if it's worth trying this at some point also? Any general advice on the approach above?",winemaking

Any problem sitting at zero sugar for a few extra days at the end of fermentation ?,"It looks like our pinot noir is ready to harvest in the next day or so - measured 23.5 brix in the field and roughly 1/5 of the grapes are just ever so slightly shriveled. 

Last time we did this it was 18 days from pitching yeast until zero % sugar - and this October we're away on a trip until day 19.

So if we have a functioning fermentation and the yeast burns through all of the sugar how big of a problem is it if the wine must (skins and everything) sits at 0% sugar for an extra 2-3 days ?  


Someone will be here punching it down twice daily - I just won't be able to press it off the skins until I get back.

Big deal, little deal or no deal ?

Should we just leave them on the vine an extra 3-4 days and just push the whole schedule forward ?

All of this to say:

Better to shrivel a tiny bit more and harvest 3-4 days late or better to let the must sit at 0% sugar for an extra 3 days before pressing off the skins ?

power outages,"Hello all,

Today the winery i work at had a brief power outage, only about 2 hours long. But it got me to thinking. I've heard from colleagues and acquaintances, friends and industry buddies, about the horror stories (that seem to be becoming more frequent with the last few years of major fires in the west coast wine regions) of trying to do damage control while having a longer power outage, for days at the peak of harvest.

What are your favorite stories to share from your own experiences dealing with the electricity going out for short or longer periods of time during peak grape season? 

My favorite was my friend having to sneak back to their winery in the dead of night and illegally crossing the fire break to use a (propane) forklift to lift a sump above the tanks to be able to do some pumpovers.  They found a way to make their wine not be a total loss in a time of catastrophe.",winemaking

Pinot Noir: When and how to rack into secondary?,"Hi all! This is my first time making wine. I started fermenting 5 days ago with 40lbs of grapes starting at 22.9 brix. Now the wine is at 7 brix and it’s been at this for about two days. It’s smelling good and still bubbling (just a tiny bit of bubbles). Should I wait for it to go dry before racking into secondary? Also, when should I press my skins out? After the wine goes dry before I rerack?? What exactly do I do for secondary? Last question: I feel like fermentation has slowed down a lot, is this normal or should I pitch more yeast? Thank guys!",winemaking
"Do you leave all the seeds in the Concord grape must during primary fermentation, or do you remove some or all?","I’ve been using From Vines to Wines as my guide (as well as other source) but as far as I can tell, they do not specifically mention what to do with the seeds, just that seeds left at the bottom will be removed during the transfer to secondary fermentation. 

Is it normal practice to leave all the seeds in the must, remove some or remove them when stemming?

Additionally, In Vines to Wines he suggests leaving 1/10 of the stems in during primary fermentation to help the wine later on, by incorporating all the seeds would this step then be skipped?

Thank you!",winemaking

Increasing gravity of initial must using grape concentrate.,"I'm making some wine out of grapes from the backyard and the initial gravity of the must only measures at 1.040.

I have quite a bit of head space in the carboy, but don’t want to add water to the wine as I don’t want a watery wine, how bad is oxygen, does it really affect the flavour that much. I was thinking the marble trick would be best, just need to find a place to buy marbles.

First Wine - Vintner's Best Elderberry,"Hi all!  I started my first batch of  Vintner's Best Elderberry Wine on Sept 8th.  I started with a 1 gal batch to see how the process went.  Going into the fermenter it had an OG of 1.066, and I pitched Lalvin 71B yeast.  2 weeks later (9/22) I measured 1.002, and racked to secondary in a glass carboy, being sure to fill as close to the neck as I could to avoid air.  Since racking to secondary there has been no activity in the fermenter.  I have it next to a mead I started at the same time, and the mead is in secondary bubbling nicely.  I got curious and measured the SG this evening and it is still 1.002, maybe 1.000.  According to the instructions it should stay in secondary until it measures &lt;=1.000 then you stabilize and clarify for a week before bottling.  My question is, should I go ahead and stabilize and prep for bottling, or does it need to go the full 4 weeks in secondary, doing nothing (that I can see).  I've never done wine or mead, only brewed a few beers.  So this is a different process, but the mead seems like it's on the right track, while the wine seems stuck.",winemaking
Secondary fermentor timing,I’ve got three different types of grape wines fermenting.

They are still bubbling pretty hard still. Should they be racked into glass or should i wait out the violent fermentation a little longer?  I’d like to avoid foaming through the air locks,winemaking

Top off headspace of hibiscus wine? Still fermenting (slowly).,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a six gallon batch of hibiscus wine fermenting. Starting SG was 1.100. I first fermented in an open bucket and had a TON of foam. It took two weeks in the bucket for the foam to die down. After the foam had died, I measured the SG at 1.030, and I was getting nervous about the long exposure to air and oxygen. I racked it into a 6 gallon carboy, popped an airlock on there, and have watched it as it finishes a slow fermentation. 

That was two days ago. I'm nervous about the amount of headspace. There is about 5.25 gallons of wine in there, still slowly fermenting. Pic attached, bubble about every 3 seconds. 

I'm not sure if it's producing enough carbon dioxide to protect the wine from oxygen. What do you think I should do? Here are my options. 

1. Leave it. It's been slowly but surely bubbling for 48 hours. The CO2 will displace the Oxygen, if it hasn't already. 
2. Top off with hibiscus tea. Adding .75 gallons of tea will drop the final alcohol content from 13% to 11.5% (perfectly acceptable), and hibiscus tea is delicious and is the base of the recipe. 
3. Rack to 5 gallon carboy. I was planning on clarifying in the 5 gallon carboy once the fermentation was finished. But I would lose wine in this rack, and lose again at clarifying rack.

Homemade Napa Cab: Forgot Yeast Food,"We started our primary fermentation Sunday morning. 180lbs of clean homegrown Napa Cab. I added some fresh d254 yeast, but forgot to get the yeast food. The fermentation seems to be coming along well.

Sugars started at 23.5 brix. Now sugars are down to 7.5 and the must went from 81 degrees last night to 77 this morning. (Acid and Ph levels were decent, but can't remember exactly what they were since my notebook is at home.) Ambient temps are in the mid forties to mid fifties at night with temps in the mid seventies to mid nineties this week. (Cooler last weekend).

Should I go over to the winemaking supply and get some Fermaid K this morning? Any danger of this ferment stalling? Our set up is very primitive. Primary fermenter is a 44 gallon brute. We'll be doing the secondary in some glass carboys after inoculating with some malolactic bacteria. 

Should I add some yeast food? Or just let the thing go as is.

I had a half batch going (10l) which came up first, it had much fewer blackberries in it and the result was a mildly flavoured light wine drink. This new batch? Incredibly dry and much much darker, probably as close to a red wine as I've ever got.

So my main questions are, does fruit (alot of it) usually equate to a dry finished product? Do you have any tips for a new brewer? Are there any benefits to using fruit in terms of alcohol production/speed as apposed to alternatives?",winemaking

Topping up demijohn worries/enquiry.,"I’ve heard you should top up your demijohn with water to stop oxidisation during the ageing process. The wine has finished fermenting, about a week ago, and I couldn’t help but splash out a few glasses to friends last weekend while we were already merry.

The fill level is now at the fully perimeter of the demijohn, completely under the neck, so maximum surface area exposed to air and I suppose maximum potential for oxidisation, if it’s not already happened completely. 

I don’t want to top up with water, but would have still liked to rack it another time into another demijohn to help it clear.

Is that out of the question now? Do I have to bottle it or fill it with water to avoid oxidation? Won’t adding water take my percentage right down and just water down a nice finished product?

Sluggish fermentation or am I OK?,"Fruit: Plums
OG: 1.094g/L
Yeast: D-47
pH: 3.4-3.5
Free SO2: 11ppm
Bound SO2: 60ppm? (guesswork, lack equipment for measuring)
Time since inoculation: 14 days

The hydrometer reading seems to drop 1.003g/L a day on average recently. For the most part the fermentation has been very healthy, but then the temperature dropped and it took some time before I found a good place to store it at the proper temperature (1.030g/L at the time). Since then it's been a little slower. Now almost a week later it's at 1.015g/L and yesterday 1.018g/L. I'm not sure what to expect in terms of fermentation speed closer to the end of the fermentation. Temperature of must is at 17-18C, while the yeast is rated for 15-20C. During temp drop it went down to 14C however.

I prepared the yeast slurry with GoFerm, then added 3g of Fermaid O to the 14L batch post lag phase, another 3g 24h later, then a final 3g at 1/3 completion. I've had some minor issues with H2S odor, however it seems to come back even though I rack or aereate - could there be a nutrient deficiency? D-47 yeast have low requirements though.

Can't get must to ferment,"Hi all,

Saturday the 24th I tried to make my first wine. 
I had a lot of grapes from my father in law. Around 15kg red and 15kg white grapes.
I don't have a grapejuicer. So I did it al by hand.
Because I did it all by hand it took long and I did not want to risk contamination. Because of that ive added campden (powderd) but ive misread the package.
Ive added to around 15L of juice 2 teaspoons of campden. I quickly discoverd my mistake and thought well, it should disipate after some time. 

The first 3 days i've let the fermenters open with a cloth over it and shaked it everyday morning and night. After that i've added the yeast. In the first 24 hours I did not see any activity, measured the fg and it was the same. 

No worries, 3 more days of shaking should do it. Made a big starter to give those little guys a fighting chance.
Again, after 24h no activity.

Okay starting to get worried. Bought a paint mixer and made a new starter. Another 2 days where I went to town on the must with the paint mixer, 2/3 times a day.

Sugar content 0. Classico Wines,"Hello fellow winemakers! 
Southern Ontario here and wanted to pick your brains about an issue that has caught us for the second time in 5 years.
We bought from a dealer as we usually do, boxes were branded ""Classico"" and we got our usual Alicante, Grenache, Ruby Cabernet.
This recipe was made by my nonno all the way until his passing 2 years ago. And out of all the batches, this is the second one to go bad in almost 70 years with the crated grapes marked ""Classico""
We noticed right from the gate that there were 0 wasps flying near the juice. Strike one.
After handling the juice and going from barrel to torchio back to barrel, there was no stickiness to anything after drying. Strike 2. Finally, grabbed the hydrometer to test the musto and was looking for our usual 20-25 reading and we were greeted with a 0. Swing and a miss.
I ran a test with a can of coke and grabbed an 18 so the hydrometer is functional, it's the grapes. 
We have solved the issues and are now working to try and save our hard work and money.
My question is this.
Anyone else in Southern Ontario Canada noticing a sour wine right from the beginning?
Little to no sugar in the grapes?
Leaving behind a white stain on top of the purple stain if any?
No purple stains at all on any buckets or the torchio for that matter?
We have been banging our heads against the wall trying to solve this. We have some theories but are reaching our to our Canadian peoples to see if anyone else has run into this issue. The last time it happened, 35 people qe know who purchased the same grapes marked ""Classico"" all had their batches go sour and bad.

Any info or comments would be great! Hope everyone has a good season and your wines come clean and crisp!

Slow Ferment - Next Steps?,"I've gone through many posts on this sub about stalled fermentation before asking about this, but wanted to ask specifically about my case since it seems like a bit of a grey line and i'm a bit confused. Essentially I have a small batch of homemade grape rose wine (original post with recipe [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/winemaking/comments/psamob/grocery_store_rose_to_age_or_not_to_age/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) that seems to have slowed down a lot near the end of fermentation. 

\- I started fermentation early last wekend with Lalvin D-47 yeast pitched with a starter - it worked really well up to a point, bubbled hard and fast for a couple days and got through most of the sugar in that period (from 19.5 brix down to 6 brix in about two or three days). 

\- Since then, it has stopped bubbling but has not cleared at all. I wanted to get it totally dry if possible, so I made a new starter with Red Star Premier Blanc yeast and some added sugar, and pitched (two or three days ago). It seems like there was some activity - light foaming mostly and a slightly different smell - but the bubbler has stayed level throughout. 

\- Brix was reading at 5 yesterday, so it had gone down a little but not a lot. Still has not cleared and I'm afraid of opening it too much more because I don't want to oxidize if the fermentation is nearly stopped. 

What do you all think the move here is? Should I leave it alone for a week and try to just let it eat up the last of the sugar (even if the bubbler seems to be staying level?) Is there benefit to racking now or adding something to help the ferment finish? 

Some extra details that may be useful: all my sugar measurement is with a refractometer. PH is somewhere between 3.4 and 3.5. Fermentation vessel is a gallon but the volume of the liquid is only around 0.6gal so there is unfortunately a lot of headroom. I'm fairly certain there is no air leakage but only as certain as I can be as an amateur just starting out, so not 100%.",winemaking

My plan is below:


Juice - Malbec (California)
Yeast - Lalvin RC212


PRIMARY

1. Open bucket, measure brix/gravity. 

2. Add sulfites

3. Transfer to wine bucket. Wait 24 hours for sulfites to offgas

4. Add FermStart to water and rehydrate yeast (RC-212). Pitch yeast.

5. Add sacrificial tannin (FT Rouge Soft)

6. Add Fermaid O

7. Add Opti-Red

8. Check gravity over next three days. After 1/3 sugar break, add Fermfed

9. Monitor and check gravity 1-2 times/week

10. Final gravity should be 0.990. 


SECONDARY

1. Rack to carboy, top-up.

2. MALOLACTIC FERMENTATION???

3. OAK??? (spirals)

4. Add 1/4 tsp of potassium metabisulfite per 6 gallons of wine.


BOTTLING

1. Add fining agent (SuperKleer)

What was the drill-like machinery at an Italian winery?,"Hello wine makers,
i have a question regarding a machine that i saw at a winery, and i have no idea what was it used for. I observed the winery when i went to buy some wine, and it was just the time when the local farmers were bringing in their crops.

Just after they weighted the trailers full of grapes, and before they unloaded it into some kind of transmission line, the winery personel used a machine that looked like a drill encased in a long tube (kinda like an archimedes' screw). The machine picked up some of the grapes, transported it to the top and then sprayed the crushed grapes back into the trailer though a nozzle.

The personel would sink the drill into the trailer a couple times in different locations, and then the trailer would be directed to the transmission line.

Is my Merlot harvest doomed? End of summer and nowhere near ripe yet.,"I've been taking regular measurements of my grapes, and they don't seem to be anywhere near ripe yet. (See linked charts)

https://imgur.com/a/VNwBK2Y

I'm in the Pacific NW, and it looks like the end of summer is arriving very soon, lots of cooler weather and rain in the near forecast. My book I've been reading gives two measures of ripeness. One is Brix/TA% should be roughly 30, or the Brix * pH^2 should be over 260. 

If I linearly extrapolate where I am now to when I would roughly hit those marks, it seems like it would take another month to hit those levels, and that's assuming they continue to ripen at the same rate, though I am suspecting even they will not due to the cooler weather. 

Do grapes continue to ripen in the late fall, or should I just expect these to shrivel up and waste away before ever reaching their maturity?

I'll guess that my vines just have way too much fruit, this was my first year trying this process and my vines are a pretty dense jungle with many many many bunches. Perhaps next year I'll try to prune the fruit more aggressively. Should I just write these off for lost?",winemaking

Apple Wine Re-racking needed if chunks or sediment on bottom?,"I have three carboys, all at slightly different stages. I'm wondering if I need to rerack or can just let them sit for months. Starting gravity was  around 1.040 to 1.055 with sugar added.

 

* After the 8 days of initial fermentation with fruit in, my gravity was
   * 6 gallon crab apple 1.020 - tasted like a dry cider. Tasted pretty good!
   * 6 gallon apple -1.050 - tasted like a sweet raddler? Hasn't changed much in gravity.
   * 3 gallon apple - 1.000 - tastes like wine! Surprised at how fast this went. Maybe because less gallons to yeast ratio and less sugar?

  
Now two weeks later...

**3 gallon apple wine**

looks like this: [https://imgur.com/a/Hbv2rxr](https://imgur.com/a/Hbv2rxr) nice and clear :)

It's got around a quarter inch of sediment at the bottom. Is it okay to sit with that on the bottom for months while it is aging?

  
This is my plan - let it age for months, and then do the campden tablets - wait a day, sorbate - wait a day, then rack once or twice more to get sediment off, sweeten and bottle all in one day? Does that sound right?

**6 gallon apple wine**

Concerning “Orange” Wine,"In the next few days, I will endeavor to create my first wine. I recently moved to a house that has grape vines in the back. Since my wife and I are not the biggest fans grapes, we decided to give wine making a try. 

In my reading, I have learned that reds are to be left on the skins, while whites should rest on the skin for no more than 8-12 hours (if at all). 

If the skin of the reds make the wine better, why would they not make the white better? Does it have to do with standard convention of flavor? The only explanations I have been able to acquire, speak on the technical aspects of why it “ruins” white wine, which in truth I do not really understand yet, nor do I have the luxury of time to fully comprehend since I do not want to leave the grapes at the mercy of the elements much longer. It was only about 10 days ago that we learned our grapes were real grapes.

In truth, I do not have a refined palate. I think Panda Express is the pinnacle of flavor and I cannot tell a good wine from a bad (I only recently discovered there are some wines I like). My wife’s palate is only a little better than that. 

For this season, we have little hopes of making good tasting wine. We are making wine simply because we enjoy growing, planting and making things, such as sauces and beverages. I also studied classics in college, and I really enjoy the idea of engaging in activities of the ancients (albeit with better biological tools at my disposal).

Tl;dr / summary
Will leaving the juice of the white grapes on the skin for the primary fermentation truly result in the abomination promised by so many? Would anyone be able to describe how it affects the flavor in less technical terms?

Or is it simply not a conventional practice and is this frowned up?

Thank you all for your input!!",winemaking

Corks for secondary fermenter and proceeding actions,"Hi, I am back with my first winemaking experiment. 

So fermentation in primary started and went well, waited till it slowed down and didn't foam as much and then transferred to the secondary.  it has been almost 7 days in secondary and for few days there is no visible activity in the wine - bobbles has stopped rising.  There is a brownish foamy substance at the top - I think it is dried up foam - is it ok?  There is a visible sediment layer at the bottom about a width of a thumb. Should I preceded to rack off the sediment - is it ok to add tap water to fill to the top of the secondary container (its volume is about 3l). 

I have noticed, that corks used for secondary containers are leaking. How do I know - when I press it I at the first some air gets displaced but then visually I can see how liquid levels out in the airlock. Meaning that pressure equalizes some way. My setup can be seen in the image. 

Haven't worried much about it for now because of rising CO2, but once fermentation stops - this means that air can get in some way. That isn't a good thing - right? I see it good on my second secondary - bobbles are rising but the airlock is at the level all the time. Cork and airlock sit quite tight. Nay recommendations?

Late nutrient addition to revive sluggish fermentation,"I have a 5 gal batch of apple wine that's been fermenting for 3 weeks or so and is seemingly stuck around 1.01 s.g.

Today in an attempt I added about 2.5g of fermaid O and stirred the lees back into suspension to try to revive the ferment, but doing more research I've read that adding nutrients too late in the fermentation can lead to off-flavors or even bacterial spoilage if the yeast don't consume all the nutrients.

Smelly wine: age or toss?,"A while ago I posted about my (dumb) first winemaking attempt - some Kyoho grapes that I tried to make in a rose style. Early on in the process I tried for natural fermentation and it didn’t take off, so I got some red star premier blanc yeast and pitched into a very smelly fermentation. Since the beginning (after I read more and started learning to know better), I’ve suspected this thing to have either some nasty yeast or bacteria action going on. The airlock had a rotten egg smell throughout fermentation. It cleared and stopped bubbling a couple days ago, though, so I let it settle, racked and stabilized today.

So here’s the problem: this thing is still smelly! It has a major rotten egg smell (along with some backgrounded wine aromas). The taste is somewhere in the neighborhood of white wine, but with a strong sharp pennies/metal taste. The aftertaste is more promising - you can actually pick up some grape/rose fruit character.

I spent three years in food service. My gut tells me, anything that smells like this should be thrown out, but since this is my first wine I feel obligated to at least ask first. Do any of you think that this might be worth hanging onto? Will the flavor and aroma of this improve at all with airtight time in bottle after stabilization?

Ps: advice from this community got me up and running on a much more promising project that doesn’t smell like butt, so thanks for the support thus far :)",winemaking

Grocery Store Rose! To age or not to age?,"https://imgur.com/a/2WBqGnS

I’m a homebrewer that has done tons of kombucha and has been looking to try my hand at wine. I decided to try an experiment: pick up a bunch of grape varietals from different grocery scores, test their must and see what I could make by combining them. Here’s what I got:

1 lb Thomcord grapes. BRIX 20, pH 4.2
2.5 lb Gum Drop grapes. BRIX 26, pH 4.4+
3.2lb generic green seedless grapes, BRIX 15, pH 4.0 (these are same sugar and acidity as the other ones but tasted WAY better and made more juice)
3.7 lb generic green seedless grapes, BRIX 15, pH 4.0

I crushed them all and squeezed/removed skins from the green ones (but left skins and seeds on the reds). Then combined all musts together. Got something at BRIX 17.5, pH 4.1, used tartaric acid, fresh lemon and table sugar to get that to 20 and 3.5. Then I fridged them for a 20 hour skin contact before pressing out the red skins, settling and racking. Then made a lalvin d-47 starter and pitched!


Confession time: A few months ago I fell in love with the tannic and complex taste of Tavel, and got curious about how it was made. The long skin contact period with both white and red grapes is a vain attempt to try to get something (even a little) close to that character.

Right now I’m 2 days into fermenting and it’s very fast. One of the things I regrettably can’t control as well as I like is heat. Lowest I can keep my apartment is 72, and I’m worried the yeast will be too rigorous and destroy whatever little complex notes might have been there. Right now the airlock smells exactly like bananas!

This is my second year making wine, last year I added nothing and had no problems. This year I thought I would ""educate"" myself more, and here we are.

A few of my friends that make wine keep telling me that is too much space and I will get vinegar, whereas much of what I have read online said for the primary fermentation more space is good. As of now I have added the campden powder, then adding the yeast tomorrow.

Here is a pic:  https://imgur.com/CnPaxMp 

Would you recommend I add some distilled water to fill the space up some more? Or should I be fine?

I am very nervous about this, so thank you for any help!

Tips for a newbie looking to buy a small vineyard/some land?,"Hi everyone 😊 Not sure this is the right subreddit to do this but here we go:

For some time my friends and I have thought about buying a (very small) plot of land or vineyard and make our own wine. Think 0.2ha or even smaller! We'd just like to cut our teeth on it and see if it's worth scaling up.

But we're complete noobs, city guys (Milan, Italy), and we're worried we'll be very easy to rip off as admittedly we don't know what we're doing, so I thought I'd ask for advice here!

What are some important things to look out for when looking for land/a vineyard to buy? Including the very obvious, like exposure to sunlight—assume zero prior knowledge!

Thanks so much for any help 🙏🏼

I think I am on to a new wine-making discovery(probably not) but I need your help.,"Some wine recipes(especially fruit wine) require some added sugar. Oftentimes people will add fructose in form of agave nectar or honey to make the taste more complex. I was recently wondering if perhaps adding some Allulose instead is a good idea. I think it may add more complexity to the taste and a brand new taste to wine but I am not sure. Allulose is often used as a 0 calorie sweetener since your body can't digest it. Does this mean yeast can't? I don't know. On the other hand, however, I think it should be able to since it is almost identical to fructose(sugar found in honey, agave, and most fruits) with the only difference being is the OH being on the outside rather than the inside of the molecule. Another scary factor is that sometimes fermenting things can produce dangerous chemicals or dangerous types of alcohol (like methanol is produced when pectin is fermented), This is unlikely to happen with allulose since it is just a type of sugar, but again, I don't know since I have never tried this and neither am I a chemist or a pro wine maker. As you can see, this is a high risk to reward game, where on one side there is the potential to find a way to add new tastes and complexities to the wine but on the other hand completely screwing it up or maybe even poisoning yourself. So if anyone attempted this or has any knowledge of what will happen please share your results",winemaking

I also pressed roussanne (after crushing) to 3 bar but that was trying to get enough juice out of a ton of grapes to be able to fill 2 barrels and have some topping up wine. I was tasting the juice, and of course there's ton of sugar in the juice which makes it tricky, but I couldn't taste any extra tannins/bitterness in it vs 1 bar.

Plum wine smells like root beer and gives off slight H2S hints,"Batch size: 14L
Starting gravity: 1.094
Current gravity: 1.067
Days since fermentation started: 4
Must temperature: 16C
pH: 3.4-3.5
Yeast strain: D-47 (regular dosage of 2.5g/10L)
Free SO2: 13mg/L (estimated bound SO2: 60mg/L

I prepared the yeast as recommended by the scott labs 2020 manual with GoFerm. I added 3g of Fermaid O at fermentation signs, 3g 24h later, and will tonigt add another 3g at 1/3 completion.

Wine is giving off slight sulphur hydrogen, not sure how much is normally expected during fermentation. Fermentation isn't at all sluggish, it keeps a steady pace. Not sure if the must temperature is too cool, the yeast prefers 15-20C, but with +2C from fermentation heat in mind the cellar don't really feel that cold, I suspect the floor is a bit colder so I've placed the bucket on a box to keep it off the floor.

Most strange thing is the root beer smell. I haven't used this yeast before so I don't know if it might be a temporary thing in must that will disappear later during bulk aging. Or if this is because of the higher amount of sulphites present. I had a lot of trouble stabilizing the must because of what I now realize was a bad strategy (worth mentioning that I didn't chemically measure bound sulphites, I just backtracked ased on titration after adding sulphite amounts). However I detect no struck match odor. In any way this smell wasn't present in the must prior yeast inoculation.

Maybe pitch wine yeast later if the yeasts can't ferment out enough and I find it too sweet.

Freezing juice to make wine??,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I tried my hand at winemaking last year for the first time and made 3 batches : apple, plum and blackberries.

The blackberry batch was surprisingly not bad, the plum was OK but not all that enjoyable, the apple is basically jet fuel.

I was hoping I could change that this year. 

I visited a local cider factory and they explained that the reason they don't make apple wine is because it's gross. They ferment the juice up to 8-9% alcohol then dilute it with water and add sugar to get to a sweet cider at around 5.8%. 

However, there is one exception as they do make dessert apple wine which tasted very sweet and ""apple-y"". Apparently what they do is they extract the juice from the fruit and freeze it then melt some of it back. Supposedly, what melts first is a super sweet juice concentrate and they can then leave what is mostly water behind.

I have done a bit of Googling but weren't able to find much about this technique. Is this something anyone's tried at home? Is this legit? Where can I learn how to do it?

I have access to a ton of apples in my neighborhood and would very much like to try this.

Low sugar low pH grapes,"Hi all, I’m new to wine but have been making beer a while.

Late fermentation start - should I be worried,"Hi, greeting from Latvia. North of Europe. 

Decided to make my first batch of wine this autumn. Collected my own grapes, squished them and added K-meta as per the description on the package (3g for 100l). 

The thing I missed out and read too late - I should have wanted 24h before adding wine yeast. But that's ok posts on this subreddit and other places calmed me down. I just mixed everything really well often and did nothing.   
The smallest batch (\~4l) started to bubble around 24h later and now is sitting in the basement happily bubbling away.  The largest managed to start bubbling only today - about 60h later. my question is should I be worried that it could be some bacteria or stray yeast that got inside while my bucket was opened and I mixed it in or the chance is low and I just let it do its thing from now. 

Also question about when to stop maceration and remove all the skins. With the smallest batch that's easy - I will do it as intended around 5/6 days from the beginning. What about the largest bucket? Remove skins at the same time or wait for the 5th/6th day of the fermentation?

Question for grape experts - why does my wine have minimal / no aroma?,"This is my 6th year making wine from grapes grown in the vineyard of a (non-professional) family friend. They grow Sauvignon Blanc and Syrah grapes, and I make each of those into a single-varietal wine, no blending. Generally there's 15-20 gallons of Sauv and up to 5 gallons of Syrah.

None of the wines have ever had much aroma; generally I feel that commercially available wines have more. 

Wines are fermented in the living room of my un-air-conditioned house. Some years we've tried to keep them cool by dropping frozen water bottles into a cooler with them, but we haven't been super consistent. 

For oxidation control, I use sulfite (and Titret test kits) and bulk-aging in a sealed carboy (usually but not always full to the neck). We have the ability to transfer under a CO2 blanket but have been inconsistent about that as well. 

Based on that info, do you think the lack of aroma is most likely to result from poor temperature control, poor oxidation control, something intrinsic about the grapes, or something else entirely?

This year we're trying to be better about temp and oxidation control, but there's only so much we can do without equipment upgrades that aren't tenable in a 600sqft place.",winemaking

Will it work? Kyoho grape rose at home!,"https://imgur.com/a/5ypEUUh

Today I found some really beautiful looking grapes at ranch 99 that seemed more fit than most for winemaking based on their size and color. I looked them up and apparently there are some winemakers in Japan that make whites and roses with these Kyoho grapes, so I thought it might not be a bad time to try for a first winemake! I’ve done lots of kombucha before (so I have some tools and experience fermenting) but never wine. 

I hand crushed 3 pounds of grapes and left them outside for a 4 hour mastification with the skins. Here are some (amateurish) measures I took to try and help it work:
- I’m not using winemaking yeast, so I crushed the grapes without a thorough wash (though I was careful to leave out suspect looking grapes)
- additionally I tried to encourage some wild yeast capture by leaving the must outside covered with cheesecloth in the evening, by my plants. I also dipped some of the leaves from my herbs into the must to ensure some wild yeast was introduced 
- at the beginning of the skin contact period, I added some lemon juice to try and make absolutely sure the PH was low enough to not harbor tons of bacteria. At the end of the day thought my amounts are a complete shot in the dark guess. I added roughly 2 or 3 TBSP of juice to about a liter or so of must 
- I strained and pressed the juice as much as possible with home implements and ended up with maybe almost a liter of chalky pink juice. It’s all being kept at room temperature in an airlocked glass vessel. After seeing some tiny bubbles form in the liquid I am rather encouraged, but don’t want to get my hopes up!

My question: do y’all think this might actually WORK??? 
Any tips to help this along are very appreciated, if you think it might have a chance at coming out. Thanks so much!",winemaking
Questions about stopping fermentation and sweetening/diluting wine,"**Guide**

Okay so  I am following [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMYuaEAswM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMYuaEAswM&amp;t=112s) (recipe below), though I made two 6 gallon containers and one more like 3 gallons, so some things adjusted (I might have done extra pectic enzyme and campden tablets than I needed too for the 3 gallon, but I imagine that is okay). Everything I've been learning as I go, total newbie.

&amp;#x200B;

**Process**

Here are my photos and general process

* Cut up regular apples
* Crushed crab apples with sanitized ice pick handle (cause I'm canadian)
* Crushed crab apples in nylon bag, apples free floating
* Added a bunch of sugar (20 cups?) to get gravity around 1.040 to 1.055. Though tough to trust my hydrometer with little bits of apple around it
* Waited 8 days and then strained apples out from one bucket to second bucket. Then transferred to carboy
* After the 8 days, my gravity was
   * 6 gallon crab apple 1.020 - tasted like a dry cider. Tasted pretty good!
   * 6 gallon apple -1.050 - tasted like a raddler? Hasn't changed much in gravity.
   * 3 gallon apple - 1.000 - tastes like wine! What happened here?
* My 6 gallon apple also had bits of apple I missed in the straining. I put a airlock on, and then after I waited a bit they all came to the top and it was foamy. I tried to take the airlock off to scoop them out with a spoon, but then it started foaming like crazy! I switched to a ""blowoff"" tube into a bucket of water and that worked great.
* The fermentation seemed notable for both 6 gallons after I got them in carboy. Tons of bubbles - so cool! Hardly any bubbles from the 3 gallon when I transported it, and absolutely none now.
* 3 days later now, the foam is gone and switched back to airlock, but the apple bits sank and are floating around.
* I had some extra I kept in jars and put in my fridge. A bit of sediment on the bottom of the cider. Of the 3 gallon, it's more just murky.
   * I noticed after I refrigerated them, they tasted worse. Stronger and less sweet?

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

* Why did the 3 gallon one ferment so quickly??? Done completely in 8 days. Maybe less water/sugar than yeast?
* Do I need to bottle the 3 gallon one soon since there is so much air in the carboy? Or will the airlock preserve it?
* I find the 3 gallon wine not as tasty as the cider. Can I dilute it/sweeten it? If I sweeten, do I need to worry about fermentation starting again? What do people usually do to make apple wine taste better? It doesn't taste ""off"" necessarily, just a bit strong/sour.
* The leftover amounts I put in the fridge after 8 day fermentation tasted worse. Is this due to the fermentation process? Or maybe some of the pulp/sludge mixed in? Or maybe it's just a temperature thing (it did taste better I think when I let it warm to room temperature - though tough to know how much is in my head)
* Can I stop the cider and 6 gallon ""raddler"" if I want and sweeten a bit if I don't want them to get more alcoholic? I'm worried the taste will get worse if I let it keep going.
* Is the apple floaties in my 6 gallon apple carboy a big deal? Should I get them out sooner than later? Or wait until I transport?

**YOUTUBE CRABAPPLE WINE RECIPE (3.5 gallons)**

6-12 lbs ripe crabapples

1-2 lbs grapes (any kind)

14 cups granulated sugar (less if apples are sweet)

4 Campden tablets

1/2 tsp pectic enzyme

1 package wine yeast (Lalvin EC-1118 or equiv)

1 tsp yeast nutrient

Apples are best after the first frost. Crush apples, with bat or axe handle. Put apples in large mesh bag and add enough water to cover apples in bucket. Add Campden tablets and cover for 1 day. Add pectic enzyme and let dissolve for a day. Dissolve sugar in boiling water to add remaining liquid for 3.5 gallons. Cool and add to primary. Add yeast nutrient and wine yeast and cover with loose lid. Stir daily several times a day for 5 days, keeping the bucket covered. On 6th day, strain and discard apples. Rack into secondary container (carboy) and add water to bring within 2"" of top. Add bung and airlock. Rack after fermentation has slowed down and lees form. Continue to rack every 3 months until no further lees. Bottle at 6-12 months. Makes 16 bottles.",winemaking
Off flavors in secondary?,"I'm working on a yellow plum wine (recipe at end), and it's been in secondary for almost 2.5 weeks. Still fermenting slowly, SG was at 1.015 today. I sampled what I pulled out, and I think it has some off flavors to it. I'm nothing close to a wine connoisseur, so I'm struggling to identify what I'm tasting. It feels a bit harsh and acidic when it first hits my tongue, and then seems to leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste. I made a few batches of blackberry and a pear/grape wine that I don't recall having these flavors in process.

Is this something that should age out, or is something actually wrong? If the latter, is there anything to do about it now or, if not, any ideas what happened (so I don't do it again)?

Recipe:
- 25 lbs plums (not pitted - I read arguments for both, so went with the easiest)
- 10 lbs sugar
- 2.5 tsp acid blend
- 2.5 tsp pectic enzyme
- 5 tsp yeast nutrient
- Lalvin RC 212
- topped off with water to 5 gallons
- started at a 1.115 SG",winemaking

Do we need a beginner's guide?,"Hello

I'm seeing a few common posts. ""Please identify these grapes"" which I'm fine with but I might try and get things a little normalised so that people have to fill out details.

Another thing is the absolute beginners who are bewildered by conflicting advice, have beer ideas over shadowing them, or just cannot understand the guides that are about.

So can r/winemaking come up with a guide themselves? Can we get a fruit and a grape version? Would there be consensus on basic methods, ways of explaining and approaching the  processes or not dead on what are decent kit?

What do you think?",winemaking

Anyone eliminating headspace with a vacuum (brake bleed kit) instead of CO2 blanket ?,"Last batch of wine I made I was ready to bottle but there was just a bit of carbonation in the wine.

So I successfully ""off-gassed"" it by replacing my airlock with a brake bleed kit, making a total vacuum, and letting it sit that way with vacuum headspace for a day.

This fermenter is one of those large 14 gallon stainless steel buckets with the gasket lid ... I don't think there is an implosion risk here given I only had 2"" of headspace ...

So anyway ... it got me thinking that instead of maintaining a blanket of CO2 in my headspace, sealed with an airlock ... why don't I just keep the wine on vacuum *for the entire secondary fermentation* ?

Not only is the CO2 a small amount of work to put in place every time we open things up, it's possible for us to mess up the ""pour"" of the CO2 into the vessel and have oxygen there accidently.

With the vacuum pump, however, we can't get it wrong because I have a gauge there showing me the pressure ...

Comments ?

Again, I can't think of a reason this is a bad idea other than implosion risk and it seems like a full tank with only a few inches of head space won't implode ...

"First time making wine, tips?","I'm planning to make wine for the first time.
I've been brewing beer for some time and made 2 times mead. Now since it's grape season I was planning to make wine from grapes from my and my father in laws garden. I'm planning to make 2 wines, a White wine with plums from my garden. And a red wine.

Ive read up and concluded to do the following step.
1. Wash grapes and remove them from their stem.
2. Press the grapes in a colander with a towel.
3. For the White wine no peels. For the red wine leave the peels.
4. Ad campden and maybe spices.
5. After 24h add yeast.
6. Leave for 30 days and bottle

I think I missed up my primary fermentation,"Hi everyone good morning. 

TLDR: my red wine is nearing the end of fermentation but I tasted some and it’s fizzy. What did I do wrong? 

I crushed and destemmed some chelois wine grapes last Sunday and gave it some campden tablets and added the yeast on Monday. Sugar levels have been consistently dropping with last nights readings from the hydrometer coming in at: 

Specific gravity: 1.008
Percent alcohol: around 1%
Percent sugar: 2%

It was my plan to press the grape skins today and move everything over to my glass carboy but when I tasted it lasted, it tasted fizzy. Like it was carbonated almost. 

Why is the red wine bubbly? Esp toward the end of fermentation? Is it re-fermentation? Did I not clean something good enough? Do I need to degass the wine?",winemaking
[URGENT] Sulphite addition problems,"My homemade plum winemust is slowly oxidizing on the surface  despite me having added potassium metabisulphite during crushing the day before. I intend to press off the fruit now and start fermentation, but I'm afraid that the extra aereation from the pressing will completely ruin the must.

I checked the current free SO2 level using titration with iodic solution which said around 15mg/L (way too little). ""No problem, maybe the pectic enzymes draw out a lot of liquid diluting SO2"". I calculated the necessary addition of SO2 to reach 50mg/L using the Winemakermag calculator which said to add 0.4 g of campden to 8L of crushed fruit. I probably accidentally added 0.5-0.6 g of powdered SO2 and stirred thoroughly. Titration now says around 20mg/L and I'm like ""?! That can't be right that's too little"". The surface has since then continued to oxidize a little. The package for the campden powder says it's pure potassium metabisulphite, not diluted with anything else.

Do I trust the titration and continue to add sulphites until it says 50mg/L? I stop when one drop of iodic solution is enough to give it a slight blue'ish hue for at least 10 sec, just as it says on the manual for the kit.",winemaking

"First timer: Brix getting higher, but acidity still off the charts?","Hi, first time winemaker with Merlot grapes from my backyard vineyard. 

I've been measuring pH, TA, and Brix (w/ Refractometer) weekly and I feel like my grapes are getting pretty close to ripe based on sugar levels, but my acid levels are **way** above where the book I've been reading seems to suggest is in the range of normal.

In the last week I've measured my Brix changing from 17 to 19.5, but the pH has stayed the same at 2.3, and the TA I've measured dropping from 2.1% to 1.8%. 

The book I've been reading seems to suggest that at this stage I would expect to see pH closer to 3 and TA closer to 1.0%. 

I'm surprised that the pH didn't seem to fall at all in this last week, though it went from 1.9 to 2.3 the previous week, so maybe just a variation in the measurements. 

Should I expect to see the pH rising and the TA continue dropping over the next few weeks, do these numbers sound reasonable? Seems like I'm still pretty far away from harvestable based on what my book has recommended.

Asking for advice for stopping fermentation in a batches of blueberry wine that are plenty strong enough,"I have two 5 gallon carboys of blueberry wine in secondary fermentation. Both were in primary fermentation buckets for 10 days. Batch #3 (we made two batches earlier in the year) was racked off the gross lees on 8/29 (13 days ago), continues to have light fermentation activity and is at 16.89% alcohol. Batch #4 was racked on 9/7 (4 days ago). is still moderately active with a bubble burp every 5-6 seconds and is at 16.10% alcohol.

We would like to stop fermentation because both batches are plenty strong enough (!) and the continued activity keeps the yeast clusters moving with the bubbles then drifting back down so neither carboy is settling out at all.

Would racking again with the addition of one crushed campden tablet (we usually add one per five gallons when racking) and some potassium sorbate (1/2 tsp per gallon) like we do before bottling be an acceptable way to stop fermentation or should we just let secondary fermentation continue to completion and work to lower the alcohol content next time by starting with less sugar?

We also have a Buon Vino filter we could bring into play to transfer the wine to remove the yeast and clusters to slow fermentation in which case we could just add a campden tablet like normal when racking.",winemaking

What Chemicals to Monitor with Fresh Juice?,"Hi all,

Thus far the only wine I have made are wine expert kits and Danger Dave’s Dragon Blood. 

I am getting two fresh juice kits here in a couple weeks, and from what I’ve seen it’s kind of hit or miss whether or not they come properly balanced. 

I guess my question is, what chemicals do I need to check and at what part of the process?


So far it seems like I need to check pH, TA, sulfites, but it’s kind of all over the place on if I should bother testing prior to fermentation/ wait until after. 

Any guidance would be much appreciated!",winemaking
How common is it to improve flavour with juice/syrup/concentrate?,"Hi all,

I’ve been tinkering with fruit wine recipes in the past few years and although some have come out pretty well, some get good only after time, I still feel I’m lacking something.

Where I live, a lot of wineries are making local Rhubarb wine, which is very popular here.
And i’ve also tasted strawberry (sparkling) wines and mixes with rhubarb.

Some are better than others but i’ve had some that have very fresh flavours. Very fresh rhubarb-like sour flavours and very fresh strawberry like sweet flavours.

I’ve tried both two years in a row now and i can’t replicate that.

The strawberry wine is quite strong and dry and it has a strawberry scent to it and would be sweet if i added sugar, but it still doesn’t have that freshness from a fresh sweet strawberry.

I know that for example adding fruit etc to your whatever brew, their flavour remains better if you add them to secondary fermentation, after the first more volatile fermentation is over.

But that would work if i want to add flavour to something, how would I do that when I’m doing the primary fermentation from already a batch of rhubarb or strawberry?

Do people (and those companies) add some fresh juice from fresh fruit to the already fermented wine to make the flavour sweeter, more fresh and authentic? 
Or how can it be achieved?

Just tinkering the flavour with sugar and citric acid doesn’t seem to help as much.",winemaking

First Elderberry wine,"Hey everyone,

I finally got around to starting my first Elderberry wine.  I’ve been making beer and cider for years, but this is my first actual fruit wine. 

I ended up picking about 3 lbs of berries and freezing them.  Today I defrosted/rinsed them, simmered them for a bit to make them safe to consume, I added about 1.25 lbs sugar to get me to 1.099 OG.  I mashed the berries with a potato masher.  I chilled and tossed it back into the fridge with some pectic enzyme to sit for a few days.

My goal is to separate the liquid from the berries after 3 or so days then ferment with some yeast nutrient and some Lutra Kveik slurry I have laying around.

Question about volumes in recipes,"So if you're making a 5 gallon batch, and the fruit is is listed in lbs per gallon, is that per gallon of water added or per gallon of final volume of the batch including the fruit? Should I add 5 gallons of water to everything and end up with more than 5 gallons total or add everything else first then top it off to 5 gallon final volume?

It seems like the fruit makes up a lot of volume so I don't wanna end up shorting myself, but also don't wanna dilute the flavor with too much water. 

Also is there anyway to actually measure or calculate the fruit addition more precisely for my specific batch of fruit as I'm going, because the range I've seen for some recipes is pretty wide (like 3-6 lbs)? I have a pH meter and Hydrometer and acid kit and all that, can I be more ""scientific"" with the fruit addition or is it more just a matter of preference? I base my sugar addition on the SG, but for fruit I just kinda approximate by the pound.",winemaking
I’m trying to make white wine with grapes from my yard. This happened a day after I started fermentation. What should I do?,,winemaking
What do I do next?,"I've spontaneously came up with the idea of making my own wine since I didn't want our green grapes to get wasted. I've bought a fermentation bucket, hand picked the grapes (5100g/11.2lbs), made a mash and added universal wine yeast. After that I realized that instead of white wine I will get orange wine but who cares right? That was ten days ago and so far it went better than I expected, there is certainly some alcohol present. However, over the past few hours the mash has settled to the bottom and I guess the fermentation (almost) stopped. I believe there is still enough sugar present. What do I do now?

1. Add more yeast? (I believe it's already to much alcohol)
2. Add nutrition for the yeast? (How much?)
3. Make must and fill it into a balloon?
4. Make must and fill it into bottles?

Is there a chance that it now starts to rot in the fermentation bucket?

Warning: even blow off containers want to kill you,"Herein lies a cautionary tale -- one more thing that wants to inflict bodily harm to you.

My first attempt at a high OG stout (1.081, in my case). After just 12 hours, I could see the writing on the wall: a blow-off tube is going to be required. So I happily swapped out the airlock with a vinyl tube that ended in a old 1G water bottle filled halfway with StarSan.

I was amazed at the amount of krausen foam blowing through the tube and happy that the tube never clogged up. The water bottle collecting all the junk that came through the tube. After about two days of that, the expulsion diminished and just a steady flow of CO2 was coming through. 

Sweet! Lemme get that blow-off tube out of there and re-install the airlock. Might as well put the cap on the old water bottle so I don't spill it. Done and done!

A couple days later I check on the batch and notice the water bottle (now capped) was the shape of a balloon and filled with it's own krausen! Oh crap -- I have a blow-off container bomb about to go off!

Like a scene from the *Hurt Locker*, I most carefully extract the very plump container from the chest freezer, squinting my eyes for safety (safety first people!). I set the now obvious explosive device outside and wipe the sweat from my brow.

Ok, no prob, I'll just slowly unscrew the cap and let the pressure out. Hmm...this is turning easier than I thought it would.... **BANG!!!**

The cap launches out of my hand, almost taking off a finger. It bounces off the roof and lands nearby. A 6 foot fountain of fermented StarSan immediately shoots out of the bottle. As I run for cover, I wonder which of my neighbors is going to call 911 regarding sound of a gunshot.

TIL that blow-off tube contents can be quite fermentable and will live most happily in a warm jug of StarSan.

TL;DR: yeast, wort, and CO2 all come through your blow off tube. Whatever container is collecting that stuff should be considered lethal.",Homebrewing
Do I really have to dump it?,"I'm brewing my first beer with a fruit addition and my worst fear came true -- this morning I spotted some white mold on the floating raspberries in my chocolate raspberry stout.

I've racked it to a clean carboy, trying to leave as much of the raspberries behind as possible. It's currently sitting at \~4.3% (maybe more, this is just calculating based on the OG of the malt, not the fruit addition), still smells nice, and I think the fermentation may be stuck (it should have hit 6% by now, not the end of the world but may explain how the baddies took hold).

My homebrewing buddy thinks I shouldn't sweat it unless the mold turns up again on the liquid itself. He thinks it'll be fine now that it's off the fruit, but I'm worried that there's still a risk it'll make me sick.

Beer line replacing tip for keezers with collar-mounted taps,"From the ""I can't believe it took me that long to figure it out"" department comes the following tip.

My least favorite part of replacing duotight-coupled beer lines is the beer that drips from the shank end all over the place, and especially onto the porous collar insulation instead of the kitchen paper that I'm trying to use to contain the mess.

**Solution**: with the disconnect detached from the keg, open the tap, take the disconnect off while elevating that end of the line above the shank level, and blow into the open end until the leftover beer runs out of the tap.

Of course, if you believe that blowing into the old beer line will irreversibly contaminate/engrossify all beers that come within a line of sight from your keezer, don't do it.  I guess you could use the CO2 in the keg for a similar effect, but I always shut mine off the moment they start sputtering.",Homebrewing

Hornindal kveik brew going concerningly slowly,"I wanted to experiment using hornindal kveik to make a kvass-beer-esque ferment. When the yeast pouch I ordered arrived, I emptied the contents into a sterile mason jar to let the yeast settle to measure when I pitch.

* Around 4 gal boiled and cooled water,
* 1 lb of toasted rye bread soaked overnight in the hot water then removed,
* Around 15 cups white sugar
* A vitamin tablet, and 
* About 1/2 tsp DAP

had the OG at 1.086. A while after pitching just under 1 tsp of the kveik yeast cake from the bottom of the mason jar and leaving the fermenter to sit near a radiator, it was bubbling slightly. Over the next couple days, the bubbling never reached anything more vigorous than what you might expect from a cup of coke that's been sitting out for a few minutes. I've never actually seen the airlock bubble, I just hear a faint sparkling sound from the inside and noticed some bubbling any time I've lifted the lid to check or measure SG. There's no foam or krausen, but I wouldn't know if I should even expect one out of this bread-sugar kvass sort of recipe.

I should note that I think it was too hot and killed my initial yeast pitch, so after several hours of cooling off I added another 1/2 - 3/4 tsp of yeast cake.

Today marks 3 days of fermentation, and I just took an SG reading. It's dropped to around 1.076. From the descriptions and experiences with kveik yeasts I've heard of, I would expect there to be more activity, and a lower SG now than there actually is.

Hop varieties are overwhelming!,"Hey, novice here. I'm trying to make sense of the hundreds of varieties. 

My first impression, is that alot of these seems like marketing. Kind of like the 5000 different cannabis strains, where really there are 3 or 4 broad categories, and within a single category the strains are in fact extremely similar...

Does this also apply to hops, or is every single variety really unique in its own way ? Can't similar hops be sorted into categories ? For example, bitter, earthy, citrusy, floral, spicy? Those would seem like obvious categories to me.

How accurate have you gotten your iSpindle?,"First off, I know that most people using an iSpindle will say that they just use it to track temp and to know when fermentation is complete, I do the same.

I'm just wondering for those of you who use them, do you get consistent readings from them (i.e. constantly a couple of points less or more than the hydrometer) or is it generally a crap shoot each brew?

Also, does anyone regularly recalibrate their unit, or just set it up the first time and thats it?",Homebrewing
Ascorbic acid and Potassium Metabisulfite to avoid oxidation. Dosage? When to add?,"Hi.

After sifting through numerous threads here trying to find and answer to questions I found myself having to ask for your experience adding these to prevent oxidation.

As far as I know Potassium Metabisulfite is known as Campden, and are sometimes marketed in my country as Yeast Stop, used to stop fermentation in wine. I assume it would not be smart to add this to fermenting vessel...

Let's talk about auto siphons..,"I've been asking waaay too many questions here lately since I'm about to brew my first batch in 6+ months, so I appreciate your guy's patience with me. 

I hate auto siphons. I've only brewed a few batches and gone through 3 (definitely user error, but they still suck). 

The one I have looks dirty and nasty, and I just managed to get that little stopper plastic piece back into place which took a good 20 minutes. They fall out way too easily. And how tf are you supposed to properly clean them without popping that piece out anyways? The functionality is great, besides maybe a little oxidation, but other than that they're trash imo.

What are my options? Do any of you guys use something else you prefer? I'm transferring into a keg, so I'll be skipping bottling bucket completely. 

As of now I use a glass carboy. Not a huge fan of that either, but I guess it looks better than plastic (not that that matters). If a plastic bucket with a spigot is easier to manage I have no problem making my own and would gladly do so!

A Couple Quick Temp Control Questions,"Hey friends! I recently got a big chest freezer cheap on sale that I plan to convert into a keezer one of these weekends. Having this new piece of equipment means that I was able to convert my old two tap kegerator into a temp controlled fermentation chamber. Yay! 

A couple of quick questions popped up as I thought about this, **I realize these are probably 'RDWHAHB' questions** \- that is, I probably shouldn't be too concerned either way, but you know how it is.

1) As most of us probably already know, *stable temperatures* during fermentation is supposed to be one of the ways you can improve you're final beer. **But what exactly do they mean when they say stable?** I know that leaving your fermenting beer in the garage where the temp swings 40f degrees from day to night would most certainly be considered 'unstable' temperatures. But what about 10 degrees? 5 degrees? I adjusted my inkbird thermostat yesterday because the temp in there was getting close to the minimum temp for my yeast, this caused the temperature of my carboys to increase about 3 degrees fahrenheit during high kräusen, was that maybe a mistake? (albeit minor) Or is 3 degrees here and there no problem at all?

2) The other is how long should fermentation temperature be maintained? My new fermentation chamber is occupied and full right now with the beers I made over the weekend. But chances are I'm going to want to brew this weekend as well. After a week in a temp controlled environment, I think I'm going to move last weeks beers out of the fermentation chamber to make room for my next batches. At which point they will be probably sitting in my kitchen for a few weeks which is 10f degrees or so warmer than in the fermentation chamber. Does that sound reasonable? Or would they have benefited more being in there longer than a week?

Thanks everyone! I always appreciate being able to come here and ask these kinds of questions. Hope everyone had a great holiday!",Homebrewing

Status of BeerXML/BeerJSON?,"Over the pandemic I've been intermittently working on some homebrewing software to learn more about the brewing process and to have a fully client-side option that doesn't require payment/subscription/registration. It is pretty basic but does what I need. However, one thing I would like to do is switch to a file format that is interoperable with other software.

I've run across both BeerXML and BeerJSON but am not clear on how well supported either is. I'm leaning towards BeerJSON simply for the JSON format that is a bit more modern but development looks to be stalled/incomplete? BeerXML looks to be better supported but also appears to be split across multiple (possibly incomplete/incompatible?) format versions and carries considerable overhead in the format for the actual data stored. 

So my questions are: 

*   are these formats dead or are they just stable? 
*   is there a reason to prefer one over the other?

Economics of all grain recipe kits vs copying and buying individual ingredients,"I have only tested this out a few times online, but are the two points generally true?

\- Extract recipe kits are cheaper than buying individual ingredients

\- All grain recipe kits are more expensive than buying individual ingredients (even when not in bulk)

Is this what everyone else has noticed as well? Seems odd that the economics would be different between the two.  Every discussion online is about how all grain is cheaper when buying 50 pound sacks of grain, but I am talking about putting in 2 minutes of legwork and adding the grains separately to your cart.

E.g. Northern Brewer charges $28 for their cream ale crushed:

[https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/cream-ale-all-grain-kit?variant=30231838982188](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/cream-ale-all-grain-kit?variant=30231838982188)

If you add each ingredient to your cart (also crushed) it comes out to $21. A 33% savings!

NB doesn't sell in &lt;1 pound increments, but it seems most do for no extra charge. Even at NB if they bag it separately you could easily slightly overbuy and reduce the amount.",Homebrewing

Recipe help: NZ-like/tropical Pale Ale,"Hi all! Following up on my post yesterday, where I requested some advice on a tropical PA/IPA. I haven't really come across an extract recipe that fits my expectations, so now I have tried doing a kind of mix-and-match of grain bills/fermentables and hop schedules from different recipes. As I stated yesterday, I would like it kind of yellowy (without crossing into NEIPA territory) and with a strong tropical hop combination, but without too much bitterness (maybe around 50 IBU).

The below is what I have so far, but am more than open to suggestions of all kind! It is my first time trying to make my own recipe and could use some help, especially with the hop schedule. 

OG: 1.060 - FG: 1.015  


**Fermentables**  
12 lb (5.5 kg) extra light DME  


**Specialty grain**  
1 lb. (454 g) Munich malt (10°L)  
8 oz (227 g) crystal malt (40°L)  


**Hops**  
0.5 oz (14 g) Nugget @ 60 mins (just chose nugget for bittering, because I have it in my freezer)  
1.5 oz (42 g) Motueka @ 10 mins  
2 oz (28 g) Amarillo @ flame out  
3 oz (84 g) Motueka dry hop 3 days  


Like I said, I could use some inputs on the hop schedule. The selection is somewhat arbitrarily based on another recipe I found, but would like to include some tropical, fruity flavors. Am open to all kinds of substitutions, changes to schedule, etc. However, I do already have amarillo, citra, simcoe and nugget in my freezer, so would like to use one or more of these.

In regards to Omega's Cosmic Punch,"Most packs I've bought from MoreBeer have been pretty inflated; Instinctually, I've made some starters thinking it's the best way to keep that yeast happy. But so far, out of 4 brews, two have been pretty sulfury... first brew, my suspicion was lack of yeast nutrients? So all my brews since have had an addition of Wyeast Yeast Nutrients. 

Well, my last brew was my actual second attempt at a thiolized ale: 


9 lbs German pils
2 lbs carafoam
2 lbs flaked wheat

2 oz Mosaic at mash(50 mins after I reached 5.29 Ph)

1 oz huell melon at 35mins

Pitched 1 litter starter I had done the previous night(looked pretty happy to me)

Fermentation kicked off relatively fast and reached a pretty vigorous fermentation(had to switch to blow-off tube)...and then it came to a crawl, very minor activity. Took a gravity sample at 1.016 with Krausen layer keeping me from racking it. Flavor was amazing, straight passionfruit flavor, just a tad sweet. So I let it ride for another week. 
Opened the fermenter yesterday and my gravity sample was 1.009, still with a Krausen layer on top(smaller than last week) kegged it anyways and cold crashed it. As for the flavor... *sigh* sulfury, flat, thin, absolutely no traces of those precious thiols.

Reusing CO2 from a keg - I'm not crazy right? Check my math pls.,"I'm not crazy, right?  I can take a 2.5 gallon keg that's recently been emptied of beer and use the pressure (12 psi) to push the starsan out of a 5 gallon keg to purge it of oxygen.  I think the math looks like this:

2.5 gallon keg \* 12 psi = 5 gallon keg \* X psi

Solving for x = 6 psi, which should be more than enough gas to move the starsan and leave a low pressure behind on the keg.  

This feels like a no-brainer way to reclaim some of that CO2 before I keg my next batch.  As long as I'm not pushing the gas off an incredibly hoppy beer, it shouldn't matter what follows.",Homebrewing

I am making a country jam strawberry wine and it smells strongly of acetone. Is it going to age out or should I give up on it?,"Hi, 

I followed a recipe for a country raspberry jam wine recently and as the title says, it smells of acetone. 

The recipe was 5L of water, \~3kg of raspberry jam, pectic enzyme and EC1118. 

The jam has for ingredients: raspberries, sugar, pectin and lemon juice. Nothing extraordinary. 

I boiled down the water/jam mix to 7L, which would give me around a full 5L carboy to age it in. the SG was 1.090.

I cooled the brew and then added EC1118 rehydrated in GoFerm and then followed a Tosna 2 staggered nutrient addition (Fermaid O at 24,48, 72h + 1/3 break down). 

The fermentation is really sluggish and is half way through after almost 2 weeks. I did ferment trickier things with EC1118 in the past like a skeeter pee (lemon wine), which is incredibly acidic as you can imagine. 

Apparently the culprit of this smell is ethyl acetate. In beer brewing it seems to be a big No and the batch should be dumped. I am a patient man and I don't mind waiting 6 months with the thing in secondary but is it going to age-out?

"Having trouble with BIAB efficiency, any tips?","I've generally used recipes from Palmer or recipe kits from Austin Homebrew Supply (highly recommended), but I'm undershooting my OG by a lot on every recipe and adding up to a pound of DME before cooling.  I appreciate any tips or help.
Method: I brew full water (just shy of 7 gallons with my setup.  I mill to a bit finer than I used to get pre-milled from homebrew supply shops.  No clumps, and watch mash temp, sometimes move the bag around if I add mash heat.  I lauter on a cookie sheet over the kettle, sparge with however much water I need to top off before boil, and I do squeeze the bag (I know this is controversial).  Post boil,, my final volume is usually 5.25 gallons of wort.

Raw Ale with Jovaru - bitterness options?,"I’m planning on making a raw ale using my saison recipe (70% pils, 15% wheat, 15% rye, target OG 1.050) and fermenting with Omega Jovaru. Here’s my plan:

- BIAB mash per my usual procedure, will target 155 f this time (since Jovaru is diastatic, hoping to leave some unfermentables behind…)
- Mash out at 170 f, hold for 10 mins. This will also help in pasteurizing since I won’t be boiling. 
- 2 oz whole Saaz (approx 4% AA) as “first wort hops” after the bag has been pulled. 
- Kill the heat, and let the kettle temp free fall. This gives those FWH time to give any bitterness/flavors they might. 
- Another 2 oz Saaz once it hits 150, which would be similar to doing a hop stand after boiling and chilling down to 150. Hold 10-20 mins. 
- Chill down to 85 f, remove the hops (I use a sanitized colander and potato masher when I use whole cones), dump into FV, and pitch the Jovaru. 
- Ferment around 85-90f, apparently Jov likes it warm. 

I’m having a hard time calculating/estimating how much bitterness this will yield. Brewfather tells me the FWH will yield 27 IBUs, but I think that assumes those hops will be around for a 60 minute boil, which won’t be happening. The hop stand at 150 f will get me essentially no IBUs, but hopefully will provide some good aroma (I’ve done this several times before with these home grown hops). 

Has anyone done anything similar?  I’m hoping the free fall from 170 to 150 f and 20 minute hold (with kettle wrapped in towels, maybe 30 mins?) will give me the bitterness I need to balance, but I’m really just guessing. I hesitate to include mash hopping during the BIAB mash, since it seems to do little in terms of bitterness ([1](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/forum/index.php?topic=33892.0) and [2](https://www.google.com/amp/s/beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/amp/nn8JS0xA0V)).",Homebrewing

Think before you connect a floating dip tube,"https://imgur.com/a/p89cYO4

First brew of 20twentyTOO.

So I made a Cream Ale the other day and been putting my keg together to let the wort ferment in it.
Brewday went fine overall. Been at my gf place for a night and just came back this morning to check on the pressure of the fermenting beer. 
Well, there was a liter of beer on the floor and it was leaking from the spunding valve. I was like ""how tf could that actually happen?!"". I left 3 liter headspace in the keg for the W34/70  to ferment.
It took me 10 minutes of cleaning to realize I probably connected the hose of the float to my gas post instead of the beer gasket. 🤦🏽‍♂️
I opened up the keg, switched it to how it would normally be set up and hope I didn't catch any critters while working in the keg.

Bottle Variation - Unsouring a kettle sour?,"Standard kettle sour technique, 15 minute boil to sanitize, cooled it down and pitch two little good belly shots.

After it got to a pleasant tartness I did another 15 minute boil, with an ounce of hops and a bag of frozen 'tropical fruit blend' to help it cool down.

I did a one gallon batch so I put it into five bomber bottles with two little carbonation drops.

of the 4 bottles drank so far two have been spot on, pretty clear, slightly fruity from the frozen fruit and nice and refreshingly tart.

the other two have been cloudy as all get out, and zero sour, absolutely none-sour, basically just a regular American wheat beer.

Could it be that a little yeast or some hop floaties got through and during carbonation raised the PH and removed the sour? I don't have a PH meter so I haven't been able to measure the value of how sour it is, but it's almost a completely different beer visibly and flavor wise.

Best way to dry hop a beer that's already carbonated?,"I got a spunding valve for Christmas and in my excitement to use it on a lager I was planning to dry hop, neglected to take the process considerations into account, i.e. the beer is done fermenting and is well carbonated at 12psi. I've never had a beer geyser before, and it seems like adding dry hops to this beer is a good way to get a geyser; it is still at 68F and hasn't been cold crashed, and I removed the spunding valve from the fermenter. Seems there may be a few options: release pressure for a few days before cold crashing and dry hopping, cold crash and dry hop, or give up on dry hopping and just start lagering.

A little about the beer: I'm calling it a Black India Lager, based on the grist of Schwarzbier and hop combo/schedule of a Black IPA I recently brewed.

Something has gone wrong,"Quick background:

I have done about 6 brews previously.

This is my first all-grain beer brewed in the Grainfather G40.  The brew went okay although I suspect that I milled the malt too fine to begin with as there were a few times that the pump had problems.

I fermented the beer at 18°C (64.4 °F) for the 10 days that the recipe requires (it's an Old Speckled Hen clone recipe).  After vigorous fermentation for a few days, it then settled down and has been showing a steady SG of around 1.000 for the past five days or so.

I opened the top ahead of bottling to find a lot of residue floating in the wort.  It's by far the ugliest ""war scene"" I have had so far.  

Once emptied (unfortunately I had to sacrifice about 40% to preserve my brew from having all the bits in), there was the usual layer of dead yeast at the bottom of the fermenter.  I therefore think that the solid bits floating around were the remnants of the malt that was milled too finely to begin with.

I tasted the beer and it tastes okay.

Any ideas?  Is it just that the malt was milled too finely or could I have also transferred some of the hops as well?

Thanks for reading this far.  I am just trying to learn from my mistakes.

Best way to avoid oxidizing while racking?,"Lots of my extract kits have tasted similar, not in a good way. Like something was off in them. Im really guessing it was oxidation, though I did my best to make sure no splashing while racking occurred. 

I have also been fermenting at room temp, although I now have a keezer set up and will set temps inside to ferment at a lower and more stable temperatures, according to yeast preferences. 

Haven't taken a lot of notes in previous batches, which I will also be fixing with future ones. I'm really leaning towards off flavors from either oxidation somehow, bad temps (again should be fixing now with keezer), or maybe my water? I have used spring and reverse osmosis, without chemicals, which I know is a mistake. Water chemistry seems difficult to me, plus I don't even know if that's the problem.

I broke a floating thermometer in a batch, which obviously ruined it, and took a long break around half a year or a little more. This next batch will be my first since. So sadly I can't really say what the off flavors I experienced exactly were. It just didn't seem to have the bite that a good beer should.

How to determine efficiency when creating an all grain recipe?,"I just brewed my first all grain batch today (have been doing partial mash for several years) in an all-in-one electric kettle. I created a simple Kolsch recipe on Brewer's Friend based on a few different recipes and availability of some ingredients at the local brew supply store. The default efficiency is 70% so I kept it and expected some efficiency issues being my first time. All in all the brew turned out well but the efficiency I got was about 83%.

Typically when I had higher than expected OG for partial mash it was because I didn't get the temp dialed in on my propane burner and got temp spikes into the higher 150s or 160s during the mash. That was not the case as the highest temp I hit was 152F; mash temp was 150F for the recipe.

My first question is should I worry about unfermented sugars making my FG higher than anticipated? Tasting the wort, it was very light and clean so I kind of doubt this but wanted to see what others thought.

A few things to note about this brew that may give insight. I used pH 5.2 Stablizer for this brew based on the calculated pH being higher than was recommended; I know this helps with efficiency but how much idk. And I also had a pretty thick mash that made my sparge very slow. Could the slower sparge pull that much more sugars out based on residence time?

Here is the link to my recipe if it helps: https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/1236058/joe-pat-kolsch

Frustration with my Cannular,"I bought a Cannular from morebeer recently.  I actually got it discounted as a return/refurb.  They had apparently dialed it in before selling but upon attempting to seal at home the seams were leaking.  That's fine, I got a good deal and figured i'd order all the items required to dial the system in.  

I followed the instructions and got the tolerances dialed in for the 4 different steps.  This time I seamed some cans and tried to get the hang of it.  I had two or so that were immediately leaking but changed my pressure applied and got about 10 cans to refrain from immediately leaking.  

After coming back to these cans a few days later half of them felt flimsy to the touch.  Upon agitating them they started to leak and bubble around the seams.  

I double checked the tolerances and everything was within spec.  

I've since then attempted to can with various pressure applied for the recommended 1 second on each action.  I've tried applying 2 seconds on each action with various types of pressure.  

For all of these variations the best I can get is about 50% of the cans to be sealed and un-leaking after a week or so.  

I'd really love if someone who has and uses a cannular regularly confirm that they consistently get a high percentage of cans that seam properly (don't lose pressure, don't bubble at the seams, etc).  If you do could you perhaps share some advice on what you think could be wrong?  Thanks in advance for any help here im kind of at my wits end with this system.",Homebrewing

Two batches in a row oxidized?,"I've been trying to nail down NEIPAs (my very first one turned out great, ironically). Two batches ago I brewed for the first time in a glass carboy, and I took a taste test after primary ferm was complete. It tasted like cardboard/chalk so I assumed it was oxidized and since it was my first time using the carboy I thought maybe the airlock didn't seal or something, and I dumped the batch. Because of this I decided to ferment my next batch in a plastic bucket like I usually do. The batch I just kegged today has the same exact cardboard-y taste to it although it is just drinkable so I decided to keg it anyway to not waste yet another batch.

Brew more barleywine. I'm chasing 'Modern Barleywine' and Browniewine,"Hi - I’d like to encourage you to brew more barleywine, and share it along with the recipe with others.  The feedback loop of homebrewing is long, and by sharing beer and the information behind it is valuable - especially for long term projects like sours and big beers.  I just want to tell you what I’m shooting for and the process I’ve adopted.

I don’t thoroughly enjoy a majority of the barleywines I buy.  I don’t always like the classic English or American barleywines.  I like the more ‘Modern Barleywines’ like Straight Jacket, Dark Rituals, Summer Life, Hand of Glory, Ancient Future, Sight and Mind, Life Sized and my homie’s homebrew barleywine.  These boys are thick, son.  They do not meet the style definition for Barleywines - the closest might be Summer Life.

The first barleywine I brewed was Hard and Hardy from Brewing Classic Styles.  Then I found another recipe on Reddit and tweaked it a little bit.  Both had primarily a base malt with a touch of specialty malts.  Hops.  2-4 hour boil.  I think that doing all base malts with something like 2 row or Maris - with or without a touch of crystal and munich and/or caramunich with your choice of hops will land you in the general area of those traditional style definitions.

So far, only two batches have stood out.  One was a Deal with the Devil recipe I looked up and modified.  I added maybe 2-3% chocolate malt and special B because for some reason I decided I liked chocolate malt and special B.  It’s dark, tasty, and could possibly stand on its own.

The other batch came from a friend, who started blending it with stout and barleywine.  It’s browniewine, and I swear, everything it touched so far turned to gold.  Barrels were also involved.  Story goes someone ordered a grain bill mistakenly from way out of town, apologized and paid for the milled grain, and my friend took the grain bill and treated it like a barleywine.  It’s 50 lbs of 2 base grains, 5 Munich, 3 brown, 2 chocolate, and 1 c40.  The best blend that I think was accomplished involved a whiskey barrel and a brandy barrel.  We attempted to reproduce the browniewine a few months ago, and it is a touch different…  My friend inspired me with this and other big beers and most of my process came from him.

**The Modern Barleywine Process**

**Yeast** - you’re going to need a lot of yeast.  It would be easiest if you just brew something like a blond, rack the beer off of it, and just drop your barleywine right on top of it immediately afterward.  As long as you have good sanitization practices, that should be fine.  If you use a beer with a lot of hops, you’re going to want to wash the yeast.  We’ve successfully washed and used yeast from a black IPA.  If you’re friendly with your local breweries, you can take a fermenter to them and ask them to fill it with a yeast dump.  Fill ‘er up - it may settle down volume wise - dump what you don’t need.  You can’t get away with just a pack of yeast or even a starter.  I built up a starter 3 times once and still don’t think it was enough.

**Mash tun** - you’re going to need a lot of space for the grain.  Borrow a mash tun if you can.  You may have to mash twice if you can’t.  

**The Boil** - The longer, the better.  I want to hit 8+ hours.  4 minimum.  Go nuts.  This helps contribute to a bigger body, I think.  Keep checking the gravity, and just end the bittering at the last 60 minutes.  It’s also fun to take a sample every hour and line up the glasses so you can see the color change from light to dark.

**Fermentation** - Treat it like an ale - ferment 3-4 weeks or until activity almost comes to a complete stop, do a diacetyl rest, cold crash, and keg.  I’ve used a few different yeasts, but have pretty much settled on US05, which does a pretty good job getting at least 10%.  Again, you need a lot of yeast and probably want to pitch on top of a cake from a previous beer.

**Aging** - after you have kegged it, just park it in your kitchen, dining room, or wherever your favorite room temperature storage may be.  I have established ‘Barleywine Corner’ in my dining room next to my two chest freezers.  My wife hates it.  Barleywine takes a while to age.  It tastes like shit for the first couple months to the point where I thought one batch was infected or something.  Wait at least 3 months before tasting it.  It is very interesting to taste it every month or two - it continues to develop and change.  I brewed my first two barleywines on back to back days, tasted them at the same time, and almost every time my favorite one would switch.  It’s going to continue to ferment slowly while it’s sitting at room temperature.  You also have to be vigilant with cleanliness when taking samples - remember to spray all posts and quick disconnects before each connection - and after each connection to rinse off or they’ll get super sticky

**Barreling** - this is a whole thing on its own I could go into at length.  The short version is only use fresh dumped barrels right from a distillery or barrel broker, use it only one time unless you’re brave, and you only place finished and aged beers in the barrel.  No heavy fermenting.  I probably wouldn’t put a barleywine in a barrel before it’s 6 months old.  You almost always get too much barrel or have something to be desired, so you’ll probably end up blending with more non-barrel aged beer.  That barrel / oakeyness will also slowly get mellow out over months/years.  10 or 15 gallon barrels are ideal for homebrewing.  5 gallons might get too much oak too quick.

**Blending** - To blend, get a large measuring cup with a pour spout, pour into your hydrometer cylinder to measure, and keep track of the ratios.  I use a large mail scale to measure the kegs as I’m blending/transferring to another keg to keep the ratios the same.  Don’t be afraid of high gravity or too much of anything.  Yolo, son.  One of the good blends we put together was with a stout a friend made with way too much body.  Don’t know what the OG was because the hydrometer stops at 1.160.  Undrinkable.  We blended it with some of my super dry 19% stout and some browniewine - then ran it through a whiskey barrel - and it was GREAT - tastes like brownie batter.  It doesn’t matter if you have a thick body or if it’s super dry - you can always blend to correct.  I know this thread is about barleywine and not stout, but I’m telling you this browniewine is great in either.

That’s it.  There’s a lot of waiting involved, and these are super long brew days.  Lots of opportunities to screw things up.  Worth it if you don’t.  I have a handful of homebrewing friends in my neighborhood, and we’re all stacking up stupid amounts of barleywine - along with stout and sour beer.",Homebrewing

Fermenter size,"Hi everyone,

I've recently bought a 10L fermentation bucket to make some smaller batches in order to fuck around with ingredients and try funky stuffs.


The thing is... I've put 10L of wort in it, like the good old moron I am. There's like an inch of space between the lid and the surface of the wort. Pretty sure it's gonna reach the bubbler before high krausen. I've already put a bag under the bucket to spare myself some cleaning.

I've never had such issues before as I usually ferment 20L batches in 30L buckets. 


So this raises a question : 

How much ""unoccupied volume"" or free space between the wort and lid should there be in order to sleep on both ears and avoid such fuck-ups ?",Homebrewing

Should I cold crash?,"Hey folks, I have read a bunch of posts regarding cold crashing and have a couple of concerns that I am hoping you can help clear up for me.

I currently have my first batch finishing up fermentation in a plastic carboy. It’s a pale ale made from an extract kit, and I will be dry hopping in the next day or two (pellet hops in a bag). 

My only option to cold crash would be to put the carboy outside for 1-2 days (temperature will range from -2 to +4 degrees C). I have a couple of concerns with this:

1) is it even worth cold crashing in this method, because even if it helps clarify the beer won’t I just stir everything back up when I pick the carboy up and move it back inside before bottling? Or should I cold crash, bring the carboy inside, and then let it rest for a few hours so everything settles again before bottling?

2) if it is worth cold crashing this batch, is there anything I need to do regarding the airlock? It currently has starsan in it, I’m just wondering if the cold temperatures will cause any issues with cold air being sucked in.

Bourbon Oak impact on hydrometer reading?,"I just took a reading of a ""bourbon oak"" imperial stout I've got cooking. The gravity is higher than anticipated. I was wondering whether having added bourbon along with the oak would impact the hydrometer reading in some way. Any thoughts? If it's helpful, some notes are below. 

&amp;#x200B;

Brew day was 12/11. Mashed (brew in bag) at 150 and it dropped to about 148 over the hour. OG was 1.082 and used two packs of US05 that was directly pitched. Started fermentation around 66 and it climbed to about 70 as fermentation started and progressed. After a week, I bumped temp to 75 and held for a week. Bourbon and oak were then added (about 4 oz oak chips and enough bourbon to completely cover oak chips that had sat for two weeks) and it's sat with the bourbon oak at about 55-60 for about ten days. Gravity reading today was 1.023, which is higher than I'd have expected based on having done this recipe before without the bourbon oak chips. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd imagine it could be any number of things could lead to the higher than expected reading. I assume it's safe enough to bottle, though I think I'll give it another week to check. But given the addition of the bourbon oak, I wondered whether that could impact the hydrometer reading in any way. Thoughts?",Homebrewing

Help with first time set up.,"I am getting into homebrewing looking at building my first set up. I will try to keep this short and sweet. Propane based all grain system for 5 gallon batches and I will be kegging. 

I am very passionate about beer and I hope to some day go pro. I'm very fortunate to be in a place where within reason money really isn't an issue. 

I want to buy quality equipment I'm going to use for awhile and equipment that is going to save me time and energy. Time is money. I work a full time job, sometimes a part time job, and I'm an ultrarunner and lifter. I got other shit to do with my day in other words. 

I'm understanding one of the pieces of equipment that are probably the most important to buy quality is a brew kettle. Agree/disagree?

I'm likely going to start off with the big water coolers for a mash tun and a hot liquor tank and grow from there as I see fit. 

What I'm kind of stuck on is do I need two kettles and do I really need a hot liquor tank?

The only brewing experience I have is a professional set up. I've worked as a packaging and cellar assistant. I've not done a home brew before so I'm trying to think through the process. 

I'm trying to figure out if it would be most ideal to have a single mash tun and two kettles or just a single kettle and a hot liquor tank and a mash ton. 

I'm thinking about the difference between having a 20 gallon kettle to heat 20 gallons of water. Use 10 to fill my mash tun and then keep the remaining 10 gallons heated and use that for my sparge water. And then have a whole separate 10 gallon brew tank. 

Curious what some thoughts are on where I'm going with this (if anyone can even follow me). 

Additionally:

What would you want in your ideal first set up?

What pieces of equipment or accessories do you think add the most value to your brew experience/brew day?

Brand recommendations or online supply retailer recommendations are welcome. Right now I'm super attracted to the SS Brewtech systems. If there 5 gal system was in I may be tempted to hit that buy button. If anyone has this system and can comment on it that would be awesome.

Followup to adventures in glucoamylase and my path to cracking Japanese lagers,"As promised: A confused update to my adventures in glucoamylase and my path to Japenese lager topic I posted earlier: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/rg7sos/adventures\_in\_glucoamylase\_and\_my\_path\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/rg7sos/adventures_in_glucoamylase_and_my_path_to/)

Today I kegged my Japanese lager. I fermented the lager for 2 weeks @ 12 degrees, let it slowly rise to 19 degrees and had it sit there for 3 days for a diacetyl rest and cleanup any residual sugars. Then I cool crashed it to 4C for about 5 days.

Image: [https://imgur.com/a/ewbAfcY](https://imgur.com/a/ewbAfcY)

Because I use glucoamylase in the mash I expected the FG to end up close to 1.000 and instead it ended at 1.008. I normally hit my numbers relatively steadily so I checked the apparent attenuation which was 83 percent: spot on attenuation for the yeas that I used (SafLager W34/70). The beer tastes great out of the fermenter and with some time lagering in the keg I'm sure it will drop clear in a few weeks. It now also has a more reasonable 5.5 percent ABV. 

Even though N=1 it seems that adding glucoamylase to my mash has drastically increased the efficiency of the mash but it did not seem to alter the final fermentability of the beer.

Either glucoamylase is not working as I hypothesised or there is another parameter at play. I will explore adding glucoamylase in the fermenter as has been suggested in the earlier thread to see if that works as I had expected. Any other possible paths to explore?

First All-Grain Brew Completed,"Hi All,

So about a week ago, I did my first all-grain brew after years of doing extract kits, it was also the first in my Grainfather G30.  I got the Deya Hokun Stomp clone kit from Malt Miller, to help ease in to the process by having everything pre-packed/weighed.

Overall my day went well, nothing terrible happened, however, it was a longer more tiring day than I expected and it ended up delaying some early evening plans.  I'm sure I'll get better and more efficient as I do more brews.

However, I do have a few questions/queries:

* I missed my OG by quite a margin, should have been 1061, but it was reading over 1070, so I added some boiled water (I took my OG after I'd cooled and put it in the fermenter) and managed to get it to \~1064-66.  Sadly due to being in a rush by this late, I accepted it and pitched my yeast the following morning when the temperature had hit the 19C mark.  My best guess is I either didn't add enough water in the mash/sparge or more evaporated than expected and I had a good half a litre or so less than then 20L I was expecting.  I used the Grainfather app to calculate the water quantities, it's possible I may have mis-counted when sparging too if I'm honest.  Is there anything else I might have done to result in less than 20L and a high OG?
* When is best to take the OG reading? Did I do it right and take it after chilling in to the fermenter?  If I did it a bit earlier in the process, I could have mixed in the boiled water and then cool using the counter flow chiller.  Doing it the way I did, meant my temperature was too high and I couldn't do anything but stick it in my fermentation fridge and wait.
* As per my many extract brews over the years, rather than taking a sample of the wort to measure gravity, I just leave my hydrometer in the fermenter, this was recommended to me years ago by my local homebrew shop and tends to work just fine for me, I'm just as rigorous as I can be with sanitising and do my best to remove/replace the lid carefully so as not to introduce too much oxygen.  However, I went to check yesterday, \~5.5 days after pitching the yeast, and there was still a bit foamy head a few inches thick in the fermenter, is that standard for all-grain (or specifically an oatmeal stout)?  Will it still die down and allow me to get my hydrometer and take a reading in a day or two?  In this instance I touched nothing and quickly put the lid back on!

wyeast 1007 in barleywine?,"I went to the store to get ingredients for a smoked barley wine as well as a weizenbock. I accidentally bought wyeast 1007 (German ale) instead of my wheat yeast.

What do people think about using it for my smoked barleywine? Last time I made this recipe, I used US05 and it turned out great. The high gravity got some more yeast flavor out of the us05 than it normally has, it was just slightly Belgian/phenolic tasting. It wasn't really an intentional recipe, it was a ""what do I have lying around"" recipe that turned out pretty good so I was going to repeat it. 

Recipe is roughly:
OG 1.088, 9.8% abv 62 ibu, 40 srm

75% Rauch
15% 2 row pale
5% 60L Cara
5% Munich light (10L)
5% chocolate 350L

1.75oz Cascade for bittering (90m) and 1.75oz hallertau for flavor (10m)

Plus some toasted old fashioned oats and ""Chinese black slab"" sugar (equivalent to 1.75 pounds of each per 5 gallons)

"Peat Smoked Porter, Don't Fear The Smoke!","I've been a huge fan of heavily peated the majority of my adult life and I've had the idea of working peated malt into a beer for a while. Recently I noticed my LHBS started carrying Simpson's Peated Malt  so I decided to have a go with including a bit of it in the grain bill for a porter I was brewing. I have to say that it came out great despite the using considerably more than internet forums seem to recommend. I read a slew of posts suggesting the upper limit for usage was 2-3% of the grain bill (with many folks recommending even less). I used 5% and I think it's just right. Quite frankly I don't even get peat on the nose AT ALL; I only get a bit of the typical iodine/medicinal/Islay scotch character on the finish. Granted, the ppm (phenol parts per million) of the Simpson's malt is fairly variable; the malt I used was 17.4ppm, which isn't nearly as high as it can come. 

My recipe was as follows, I understand this is an insanely (and possibly unnecessarily) complex grain bill (very much a 'home-brew grain bill') but it worked out great for me...

Munton's Maris Otter - 60%

Flaked Barley - 6%

Simpson's Golden Naked Oats - 6%

Deer Creek Twilight Wheat - 5%

Simpson's Peated Malt - 5%

Weyermann Carafa II - 3%

Weyermann Chocolate Rye - 3%

Proximity Pale Chocolate - 3%

Simpson's Crystal Red Rye (90L) - 3%

Briess Roasted Barley - 3%

Briess Carapils - 3%

Green Bullet (18.8% AA) - FWH sufficient to achieve 30IBUs

Step Mash  - 140F for 10min, 149F for 30min, 162F for 20min, 170F for 5min

OG - 1.067

FG - 1018

ABV - 6.43%

IBU - 30

SRM - 34

I fermented the beer with S-04 at 62F.

I would say, if you like heavily peated Islay scotches (Laphroaig, Call Ila, Ardbeg, Port Charlotte from Bruichladdich, etc) or the likes of Talisker you should feel free to be heavy handed with the peated malt. If you're not a fan of those bottles...why are you brewing with peated malt in the first place?",Homebrewing

Heating pad under a Fermzilla all-rounder (30 litre),"My first batch in my new Fermzilla all-rounder (Xmas present) is fermenting now. I'm a little paranoid about temperature so I was very cautious about chilling the boil and putting plenty of cold water in the fermenter first (I use a ""stove-top"" process for extract brewing).

I have an old heating pad made for two 1-gallon jugs and it draws 13 watts when I plug it in (through a meter). I slid it under the fermenter (slid through the metal stand) so it was just touching the bottom, plugged it in, and found about 12 hours later that the free surface of the heating pad was quite hot to the touch. So I panicked and unplugged it, but the bottom of the Fermzilla seemed OK.

Now I'm thinking that the surface was hot because it only had air convection drawing heat off (instead of the more-or-less direct contact that it used to have with my glass ""upside-down light bulb"" fermenter). And 13 watts isn't a lot of heat output.

Hopping schedule for NEIPA,"So I’m always on the hunt for making all my beers better (as most of us are).  Right now I’m on a hazy kick in trying to get those where I want them.  I’ve done it a few different ways but recently my basic 6-7% NEIPAs have had:

1) About 10-14 grams of something like columbus at 30 min
2) An oz or so just before flameout (like 2-5 minutes left in the boil)
3) About 4 oz of whirlpool hops at 155F
4) About 2 oz of dry hop on day 2
5) About 6 oz dry hop on day 10 or so (basically right after I hit FG)

Then cold crash and keg. What’s been everyone’s favorite schedule for the super juicy juice bomb style (not working on the old school haze or the more crisp hazy style right now)?

Beer Allergies vs aggressive Cold Crashing!,"Since the dawn of the micro-brewery explosion in our city, I've been experiencing worsening problems with my sinuses closing up when drinking certain beers. NEIPAs grew in popularity and things only got worse for me. Eventually, I found myself at a place where even an innocuous-looking lager would make me regret drinking it for days.  As part of this journey, I started brewing my own beer, trying to figure out if it's certain hops or other ingredients (and only adding to my problem). During a recent (and brutal) cold snap, I discovered something!  

I brewed 2 beers, a dark dunkel and a juicy IPA. These beers are assured to cause issues for me. However, it was a nasty -35C outside when each of these were finishing up in the fermentor. Throwing caution to the wind I'd put my Fermzilla outside and get the brew down to low single digits overnight. Then kegged.

The Krausen was everywhere, It blew the bung off twice in the first day and two weeks later she's still going. The residue that it was leaving behind and overflowing with wasn't beer though. It was all yeast. They were trying to escape their physical confinements and ascend to a higher plain of existence. The best part was I got one of those clear plastic wide mouth fermenters so I could see what was going on inside. It looked like a lava lamp. CO2 was picking up fist size clumps of yeast and pushing them to the surface. It was amazing.   


I then thought. ""Well this quad will take like 2 months to finish, so I might as well make a nice beer with this extra yeast."" I knew Krausen is basically dead yeast, proteins, and hops. So I thought that there must be some living yeast in there. So I made myself another wart using the dme and opened up my fermenter and scraped some of the Krausen off with a spoon and stirred it into my starter.  It worked! No off smells, just that super floral orange smell from the 3787. I then got a copy of the Patersbeir from Northern Brewer again and now that guys is bubbling away with the same Krausen level as my quad.   


I recommend everyone try a starter if you haven't already. I think my next experiment will be to harvest some more yeast and store it. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to best do this?",Homebrewing
Lallemand Windsor British Ale Yeast - Krausen Gone within 48 hours,"I recently brewed a stout with 1/2 WLP004 for batch one and for batch 2 I used  Lallemand Windsor British yeast with a 1L 1.026 starter. 

I pitched on Sunday night at 64 degrees and put it in a location where the ambient temp is 65 after aerating the wort with filtered air and an aquarium pump w/ aeration stone for about 1.5 hours. I noticed that the kausen for the windsor yeast has totally dropped out so I took a gravity reading and it's at 1.032 which is about 56% attenuation. I took the temperature of the wort and it's sitting at 69F. 

Does anyone have experience with this yeast? Does it keep on chewing or do I have an insanely sweet stout on my hands? I'm wondering if I get 80%+ attenuation on the other batch if I could blend them to get a useful product to age.",Homebrewing
Electrical brewing temp probe,"So I’m trying to work out some pieces of switching to electrical brewing. I currently have a kettle with two tri clamp ports, one in the front as a spigot and one in the back for an element both 1.5in.

Feasible to dismantle a coupler for cleaning purposes? Or too much hassle?,"I am slowly ramping up to kegging and will be purchasing a coupler and regulator soon.

I was able to get my hands on some rather old kegs (years) that I likely won't use for anything brewing-related. I actually would like to cut them open to see what the inside of a keg looks like. To do this I believe I need to:

1. Depressurize them
2. Remove the valve
3. Hand them over to a buddy that works with metal + stainless steel and let him do all the hard work :-)

To depressurize, I've seen some YouTube videos where guys just use a screwdriver but it looks dangerous. I was thinking about just hooking the kegs up to a coupler (once I buy one) and depressurizing it the right way. My only concern here is likely contaminating my coupler with whatever is living inside the kegs right now.

So I ask: is it feasible to take a coupler apart completely so that I can super clean it afterwards, or is it too much of a PITA (in which case I might give the screwdriver method a try if there are no other suggestions). Thanks in advance!",Homebrewing

My thought on locating outside is that it won't be a big deal because I can install check valves in the system to prevent convection driven gas flow between the stuff inside and the tanks outside of the keezer. And doing so will give me better access to the tanks plus a bit more room in the keezer. Is there any updated wisdom on where the CO2 tank should be located in a kegerator or keezer setup?

Yeast isn't making any noise??,"I received a Northern Brewer starter kit. We brewed the wort, sanitized and pitched the yeast. It's been fermenting for about 5 days now. Initially the airlock was making noise, there was tons of gas exchange, now its gone silent for the last few days. I ordered a hydrometer, is there anything else beside taking some measurements that I can do to ensure the yeast is doing its thing? I'm fairly sure the fermenter is just not sealing, which is causing it to not be air tight. Is it worth it to consider adding some yeast if it is not fermenting? Is there anything wrong with running a carboy that is not air tight?

Belgian Tripel fermentation temperature increased to 75F overnight. Is this something to worry about?,"I brewed my first attempt at a belgian tripel yesterday. Simple BIAB recipe below.

After chilling the wort down to 68F, I measured the gravity and got 1.075. This wasn't as high as I was hoping but I'm not not too worried about it. So I pitched my decanted 2L yeast starter (WLP 530), into the fermenter and thought that was that. Three hours later, the airlock was already bubbling which has never happened so quickly for me. Granted, I've never made a beer with this high of an OG, so I didn't think too much of it. 

Thinking that since it is winter and it gets pretty cold at night, I would have to worry more about heat loss than heat gain. Thus, I did not put my anvil bucket in my fermentation fridge. But since fermentation started so fast and vigorously, the fermenter had heated up to 76F by the time I checked it this morning. So over the course of several hours today, I cooled it back down to 70F with my temperature controlled fridge. There it remains bubbling away like crazy.

I know belgian beer is supposed to have a lot of yeast expression, which I quite enjoy.  Just wondering what to expect from this and if anyone has any insights as what my fermentation temperature schedule should be from here?

"Relationship between yeast, carbonation, and alcohol","Do different strains of yeast produce alcohol at different rates relative to carbonation? In other words, if I'm bottling (ginger beer) directly after pitching yeast, without doing a primary fermentation, is there any chance that I'll have a strain of yeast that produces a lot of alcohol but not much CO2? So I'd end up with moderately high ABV without a bottle bomb? Or is it pretty standard - if I'm fermenting in the bottles, I'm going to be under 2% (or a different number, but that seems to be what I've generally heard) even once I reach a decent level of carbonation build-up?

I have a brew book and I've recorded my recipes, but I've only ever used grains once (from a brewdog kit).

I have been going for about a year, having started on cider and fruit wines, and even done ginger beer and kombucha.

I've had a few issues, some beers not carbonating, some spraying fairly high. I had a mate open a beer and the cap hit him in the face and graze his nose. The beer was nice, and it didn't over froth.

Carbonation is generally all right, though, unless I get stalled fermentation. I'm never really sure why my fermentation stalls, but I suspect that a recent brew has stalled because of low temperatures in our apartment overnight.

I have a cupboard that's central to our apartment, which is on the middle floor. That's where my beer ferments.

"What is your volume loss, start to finish (packaged)?","***tldr.*** Mashing and sparging volume totals at 23L, final beer that is packaged is +-12L. How much do you start with for the mash and sparge that result in your total packaged beer volume?

\[23L = 6.07 Gal, 12L = 3.17 Gal\]

&amp;#x200B;

***Full post***

Since my new all-in-one electric kettle, I've been brewing steady with 80% efficiency.

I prefer making the smallest possible batch I can with the system, since I mostly drink them myself, and want more variety to choose from.

With my set up the minimum amount of mash volume is 20L of strike water (and 3L of sparge water). This is the minimum amount of volume I can use with a grain bill between 3,5-5,0kg. Going below theses values will cause problems for recirculation.

Anyway, to get to the point, for the brew I use 23L of water. During heating and mashing I always keep the lid on. I do a full 60 minute boil, and keep the lid off the kettle for the first 30 minutes, and leave it halfway on for the remaining time.

After boiling, cooling and fermenting, the total amount of beer that can be packaged is around +-12L. I do consistently hit my targets (with a minor +-2 point difference from time to time).

From the start I use 23L of water, and end up with 12L of packaged beer. I'm not too worried, since I reach my targets, but am wondering how much volume loss you are experiencing.

Side-note: I often use large quantities of flaked oats and wheat, and use some rice hulls which might take up some volume.",Homebrewing

Tell me this is a bad idea... [No Chill Brewing],"So I've been homebrewing for about a year now, and it's been a blast and I've learned a ton. That said, my setup is optimized for 10gal batches (split between two 5gal fermenters), and it takes me a solid half-day minimum to get through my brew day. Usually, when I split the batch I treat one as a pale ale/pseudo-lager and the other as an IPA.

In an effort to simplify my brew day and waste less water, I'm going to be trying no-chill brewing for the first time this week. I know I need to adjust any late hop additions and that in general, I should stick with more malt-forward recipes like my current pale ale/pseudo-lagers... but then I had an idea.

In doing research, it appears that, if properly sealed, no-chill cubes will stay sanitary for weeks or even months. If this is true, could I make my 10gal batch of a simple all-grain base recipe, then whenever I'm ready to actually start fermentation, simply boil a pot of DME with my IPA-style hop additions (hops still at a 5gal scale), cool that in an ice bath, then mix with my hot-cube batch in the fermenter? That way, I can have base-recipe on standby, don't need to worry about the late hop additions because the hops will still have a normal (though concentrated) brew cycle, and when I need to get another batch going I don't need to plan a whole day around it. 

Would this work, or are there implications I'm missing from boiling the hops separate from the rest of the wort, then combining later?",Homebrewing

First time making cider. White floaties in secondary a problem?,"Just looking for some advice. I've made wine and cider kits before but this is the first time making cider from fresh fruit. This was a mix of apples from a friend's back yard and others from the farmers market. 

Spent about 7 days in primary and now been in secondary for about 3 weeks. Just took a look at it for the first time today and see some white floaties on top. Really need advice on what it is and how to move forward without ruining the cider, or if it's a problem to continue and drink.

The initial starting gravity was about 1.045 and near 1.0-1.01 after primary. should be near 5% abv I believe

Apples were diced and frozen in ziplock bags. Thawed and juice squeezed out with the apples still in a nylon straining bag in the primary. Used campden tablets, pectic enzyme, and yeast nutrient about 30 hours before adding yeast.
Yeast was mangrove jack m41 belgian ale yeast 

I suspect there's a little too much headroom. I wasn't quite able to fill the 3 gallon secondary.

Any tips for preventing hyper active fermentation lift off?,"I've brewed a couple really big stouts (1.110+) with big healthy starters. About 5.5gal in the Ale Pail. I chill it to about 68-72° before pitching. It goes straight into a fridge with temp control.

12 hours later, usually while I'm asleep, the process goes from the precision of Navy Seals to some jabroni organizing street festivities in the winning city after the world cup. Absolute chaos. I will get out of bed to find beer on the floor and on every surface in the fridge. Airlock clogged and blown off. The hole in the lid looks like a chocolate gunshot wound but with a steady delicious breeze rolling through. I'm way too hungover to deal with this the next morning.

So what are some ways I can avoid or mitigate the sudden vigorous fermentation without wasting or stressing my yeast? Start fermentation slightly cooler? Fermcap? Thoughts and prayers?

I have temp control in the fridge. It's a plain brewing bucket. I've tried two different types of airlocks and all sorts of blowoff tube configurations.

Getting back into homebrewing and wondering the difference between kit brewing and extract brewing? Also need to find a way to run an immersion chiller,"I home brewed a few years back just using the basic kit brewing method. Im going to get back into brewing soon and was thinking of doing extract brewing by properly boiling the wort and adding hops to a recipe. But wondering what is the difference between this and plain kit brewing? The costs of buying all the ingredients seem similar between both methods so no real difference there. Extract seems a little more work but I dont mind that. Does extract produce a better beer or why would you choose it over kit brewing? 

Also if I do go down the extract route I need to figure out a way to run cold water through an immersion coil. Are there any adaptors out there that wlll allow me to screw off a shower head and then attach it the shower tube to the coil?

Mash Tun Immersion Coil?,"Hello All!

This is probably an insane idea, BUT I love to save money, and want to know what the community here thinks of it. I'm trying to use what I have so here goes. What I want to attempt is simple. I have two stainless pots, a pump, heat stick,  immersion chiller, temperature controller, and a dream. 

I'm not 100% for putting my heat stick into the mash / sparge water since nothing on my heat stick is 100% food grade, so my solution is this for automated mash tun temperature. Even after grain has been introduced. I will attempt to make this a BIAB no sparge method.

1. Heating up water in stainless vessel (1) via a heat stick to the max it'll let me. 

2. Heating up stainless vessel (2) to strike temperature via good ol' propane. Throw bag / grain in once desired temperature is hit. Followed by immersion chiller after that. 

3. Attach vessel (1) to pump, pump to immersion chiller found in vessel (2), and finally immersion chiller back to vessel (1) all while the heat stick continues to heat vessel (1). 

4. Have a thermowell and temperature controller attached in the middle of vessel (2) to turn the pump on and off as need be for my mash temperatures. 

Now if you were able to follow along with that. Let me know if I'm crazy to thing an immersion chiller can handle that type of work!

My wife bought me a Brewzilla for Christmas. I had expressed interest in starting to home brew and she came through!

I'm pretty clueless to what needs to be done. Spent the last 2 days watching others use it and I'm slowly starting to grasp how it works. 

I am however lost on what other accessories I need to complete the brew. I know I'll need a fermenter but have no idea what one I should get, I'll be mostly doing IPAs and would prefer to have them complete faster due to limited space. Could some of you point me in the right direction for a fermenter? Also do I need a fridge to store the fermenter? Assuming I do so I can control the temperature?

Unexpectedly slow fermentation after pitching starter,"I recently made and pitched my first yeast starter into a 5gal batch of 1.094og wee heavy. It's been 48 hours and the gravity has only gone down to 1.078sg, which is far slower than my previous fermentations. 

It was a 2l starter made with DME, yeast nutrient, and a liquid pack of Tartan Scottish ale yeast. It sat on a stir plate for 3 days then stored in a fridge for 3 days. Before pitching, I brought it to room temp, decantered the liquid and pitched the yeast cake at the bottom.

I'm currently fermenting at 56°, which is lower than I've previously attempted, and it's bubbling pretty aggressively. 

Did I do something wrong? Could the yeast starter have been faulty? Or will it just take more time? My calculations suggested a fg of 1.022, and that's a long way off after 48 hours of fermentation.

"Old, used cooking oil in my second brew","I was happily puttering along yesterday, brewing up my second batch of beer, an Irish Red Ale.

Things were already going much smoother than the first brew, no unexpected surprises. I had added the only hop addition and was probably 40 minutes into the boil when I noticed something; brownish yellow water was dripping from my stoves vent hood, and it was dripping directly into my boiling wort. Fun!

Turns out, the steam coming off the boil was substantial enough that it loosened up months of oil splatters on the inside of the vent hood, causing oil-infused water droplets to run down the slanted vent, hang playfully at its lowest point, and then drop like the hammer of Thor into my unsuspecting brew.

Tex Mex, Indian, Chinese, rancid oil, all manner of flavors are sure to reveal themselves in and add complexity to this beer, which I've decided to christen *Padaca's Potluck Dumpster Irish Red Ale*.

On a more serious note, this almost certainly happened during my first brew and I just didn't notice it, but I also didn't taste any rancid oil or curry in my last brew, so it'll probably turn out fine. What's the weirdest or grossest thing y'all have had make it into a brew?",Homebrewing
2021 Brewing Cost Breakdown,"Hi all, I’m a little late to the year-in-review posts but here goes. Last year I made a post detailing my total expenses for the year and wanted to do a follow up for 2021. Basically I spent an afternoon going through all my credit card statements and Amazon orders to tally up the brewing related expenditures. This year I tried to make the data a bit more accessible by breaking it out by category rather than vendor. 

Why bother? I tend to underestimate how much I spend on brewing so it’s helpful for me to get more accurate numbers. I am by no means the most frugal brewer out there and definitely enjoy the hobby aspects of brewing, but I hope this helps others out there as a point of reference.

For background, this is my third year homebrewing and second full calendar year. I brew 5 gal BIAB batches on a propane setup.

Ok, on to the good stuff:

**Total costs:** $1996.42 (-37% from 2020)

**Batches brewed:** 18 (+2)

**Cost per batch:** $110.91 (-44%)

**Cost per beer:** $2.09

&amp;#x200B;

By category:

|Raw Ingredients|$946.20|
|:-|:-|
|Propane|$140.00|
|CO2|$148.61|
|Equipment|$316.85|
|DIY Extras|$341.81|
|Competitions|$102.95|

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest change was in the cost of equipment. Last year I made the jump to kegging and with that came a lot of expenses. This year I was much more careful about buying one-off things on Amazon. I still had a few regrettable purchases, including an unused spunding valve and a pump for a keg washer that I never got around to building.

The category “DIY extras” included purchases not related directly to my brew day but I still consider part of the hobby. The largest costs were for starting my 4-plant hop growing setup. I made a centennial fresh-hop beer in September and will definitely be doing that again. Another big one was malting my own grain, which involved building a malt kiln that doubled as a hop dehydrator.

Ingredient costs were roughly $52 a batch. This is likely a bit lower than the true cost because I look at calendar year expenses only. For the first 10ish batches I had a fair amount of ingredients in stock already, which means I was mostly buying specialty grains, hops, water and yeast for those.

CO2 costs were down YoY, mainly because I paid for deposits on the tanks last year. Refills were roughly the same.

Competitions: I entered the NHC this year and safe to say I won’t be doing that again. I had to pay for the AHA membership, labels, shipping, and entry costs and I didn’t feel like I got my money’s worth. I received much better feedback from local competitions at a fraction of the cost.

Looking forward to next year, I’m hopeful I’ll be able to reduce costs further. I got an electric brewing rig for Christmas and that should let me reduce fuel costs significantly. Brewing additional batches should help bring cost per batch down further. I think it can get my total costs under $1600 even if I splurge a bit on upgrading my hopyard this year.

Thanks for reading and happy new year!",Homebrewing

Basic question about bottling yeast - do I risk overcarbonation?,"Hi everyone, 

I brewed this week a barleywine with wlp001 and it should end at 11% ABV ish and FG 1.020.

It is not my first barley wine and last time it got down to 1.010, aged it few weeks in carboys until the fusel alcohols disappeared (it was still at 1.010 after 6 weeks). My friend suggested to add a bit of US05 at bottling to get proper carbonation. Big mistake. My batch ended up overcarbonated (luckily no bottle bombs!).

Tips for getting blueberry flavor into a wheat?,"I'm about to start a basic American wheat ale homebrew and I want to get a little experimental. A friend of mine made this amazing spicy blueberry glaze earlier this year using her blueberries and my ghost peppers. I got inspired and decided to try and make a beer with the same flavor and I give it 50/50 on it being awesome or terrible but either way, I'm looking forward to trying it. For the spice, I'm going to make a ghost pepper tincture to add at bottling/kegging. I did that with a chocolate habenero stout a few months ago and it came out great. Figure ghost peppers specifically are the best peppers for adding spice without any pepper flavor, I'll just have to make it weak so I don't ruin the beer!

But I'm not sure how to add the blueberries. I've been reading that blueberries are somewhat notorious for being a difficult flavor to get into a beer but the two main methods I've found that seem somewhat successful are a) racking onto a few pounds of mashed blueberries in a secondary for a week or b) adding an extract at bottling. I'm leaning towards the second because I don't have a secondary atm but I am willing to finally invest in one if that's the best way to go.

I'm wondering if anyone has experience with either of these two methods and can give me a positive or negative recommendation, or if anyone has any alternatives they'd recommend. Also curious, what would adding sterilized mashed berries to the primary after initial fermentation is done and just letting it sit an extra week do?

1 gallon ale in 5 gallon carboy ... problem?,"Hi there! I'm 3 days into primary fermentation of my first homebrew ever. 

I prepared a 1-gallon batch of pale ale wort but when I funneled it into my 1-gallon carboy, I found I had more wort fluid than anticipated ... the carboy was so full, I was  worried I wouldn't have enough headspace to prevent a messy explosion. So, I transferred the whole thing into a 5-gallon carboy instead. It's now on day 3 and the yeast is clearly doing it's thing; my valve is burping away regularly and I've got a good head of foam forming.

I've gotten worried, after doing some more reading, that almost 4 gallons of air above my wort might ruin everything due to oxidation. I see one post on this forum from five years ago that seems to express different views ... yes, oxidation will ruin everything, no this will be fine, hey the CO2 blanket will protect you, no dummy, the CO2 blanket is a myth... :-) 

Anyway, just looking for some more up-to-date wisdom here. Am I likely ok, or not? And - in particular -  based on reading I've done, I've also decided against risking a secondary 'fermentation' but I do plan to cold shock before bottling. I have more hops to add, but I'm wondering whether opening things up to insert the hops pellets around Day 9 would just make any oxygen problems worse.

Thank you all for any insights.",Homebrewing

Any Way to Make a Recipe Which Is Going to Be Sour... Less Sour?,"I have a bit of a strange situation and request. I'm propagating yeast from the dregs of a Jester King beer (Rare Corals), which I'm going to use to make a table beer for the house. It's a farmhouse beer to begin with, and the starter has that characteristic sour/funky smell. Perfect, all according to plan.  

A certain prominent member of the household has made it known, however, they would like the finished beer to be not-so-sour/funky. I think it's a foregone conclusion it will be if I choose to use the yeast I'm building up, but it got me thinking. *If* I were to try to honor that request, how might I change the recipe to counteract, or minimize the farmhouse character from the yeast? My recipe is pretty much exactly the [Le Petit Price](https://jesterkingbrewery.com/main-blog/le-petit-prince-homebrew-recipe) recipe Sean Spiller posted, so we're starting from a very neutral flavor profile. 

I know if I use a farmhouse yeast culture, it will have that sour/funk character, so I'm not trying to remove it. Just... lessen it's perception. Could you add in a tiny amount of smoked malt? Use a certain type of hop? Something with the water chemistry?",Homebrewing

Duo tight fittings,"I am revamping my kegerator CO2 right now after dealing with some very slow leaks.After dealing with hose clamps, bulky red vinyl tubing and a constant degree of uncertainty for several years I decided I had to fix something. 

I came across duotight when I discovered pressure fermenting (spunding valve)  and decided to order several parts to switch over to duotight for the kegerator.

The problem is, I can't seem to keep pressure in a length of line, with a regulatorin-between two shutoffs.

I can pressurize to 10psi, shotoff the in and out lines, with about 10 feet of line pressurized and it will hold all day, but by morning it is down to about 1 psi.

I was hoping this stuff was guaranteed seal, but so far it seems less reliable than hose clamps.

I have also tried a different duotight inline regulator with different duotight fittings and have had the same result

Scottish Wee Heavy not carbonating,"Hey all I’m fairly new to home brewing. This is my fifth beer I’ve made and I have been doing the recipe kits from Northern Brewer. I made the Scottish wee heavy and it was probably my most successful brew yet with the exception that it doesn’t seem to be carbonating in the bottles very well.

Cleaning kegs between batches,"Hi Brewers!

I have only recently moved to kegging. I have just finished my first keg. My question is, can I just transfer some clean water into the keg under pressure, shake it around, then transfer it out to clean out any sediment and remaining beer, leaving a pretty clean and fully purged keg?

I feel like I shouldn’t have any issues with contamination and this would save me filling the keg with sanitizer and pushing it out with co2, thus saving a good amount of co2 in the process.

Effect of pitching temperature on Philly Sour acid production?,"Hi all - I was wondering if anybody had any experience pitching Philly Sour yeast at different temperatures, and if they noticed a difference in the lactic acid production?

I have two basic recipes I use Philly Sour for - a gose, and a gluten free, sorghum-based sour. For some reason, the gose recipe always turns out substantially more sour than the sorghum recipe, even though I usually add MORE dextrose to the sorghum. 

I initially put this down to a quirk of the sorghum, but having brewed up another gose yesterday, I tasted it today just to check in to see if I could taste any acid yet - usually I can detect it after a day or two and it maxes out about 3-4 days in. But less than 24 hours after pitching it's already VERY sour. Possibly too sour - I'm considering pitching some Voss Kveik just to try to bully it out and halt the lactic acid production.

And then I realised, due to a couple of little shortcuts I had to take yesterday, plus it being very warm here in sunny Australia, my wort was a little bit warmer than it would usually be when I pitch - it was about 36C, when usually it would be about 30C. And, due to my brewing setup and lack of chilling equipment, my gose is always warmer than my sorghum beer when it comes to pitching time.

So now I'm thinking - does a warmer temperature lead to higher lactic acid production? I have seen plenty of information about pitching rates, gravity, etc and there effect on acid production, but can't find anything on temperature. Does anybody have any insight or experience?",Homebrewing

"I brewed my first batch this year, April 24. Today, I just hit my 100 gals milestone.","Mostly just a humble brag. I got hooked and I am making my \~100th gallon of beer today. I decided to go with my best recipe of the year - a Dry Hopped Oat Lager. I am brewing now and will pitch tomorrow: ""See you next Beer!""  


I had Inhabited Form by Cerebral Brewing and thought I should take a stab at it. All I saw on the can was that it was a ""Dry Hopped Oat Lager with Citra and Galaxy"" and decided that was enough information. I was so surprised how well and how close it turned out. This recipe was all instinct, and is a bit of a crowning personal achievement for me. There was a notable difference between my friends ""liking"" my beer, and saying ""Oh, *this* is good"". The imitation was my 17th-ish batch of beer ever.  Now I am officially putting *MY* recipe out for judgement.   


SEE YOU NEXT BEER! - Dry hopped oat lager

6lbs Oats  
6lbs 2-Row  
W34/70

1oz Saaz @ 60   \[mostly as a preservative/best practice\]  
1oz Citra &amp; 1 oz Galaxy - post fermentation\*.   
\*I just threw mine right into the fermentation vessel/serving keg about the same time I cold crashed. I found that about 1-2 weeks was best, so a hops basket is recommended. It just may have had more hop flavor as my float tube got to the bottom, rather than time - there is only so much oils that can be extracted - but the hops don't really settle and I missed out on anywhere from a half to 1gal from just too much trub, so hops basket regardless.   


I kinda step mash because I don't like to strike hot - So 165 in sits a 135 mash for 30min. Drain and restrike 165 gets 152+/- mash for 30-45. Drain and drop grain bag into kettle at 175 for sparge. Pour runnings into kettle and boil.   
Whirlpool at end and wait to cool at least 180. Transfer to carboy for overnight passive chill.    
Transfer next morning to keg IN port to aerate. While transferring: grab some wort, distilled water, yeast nutrient and dry yeast in large mason jar. Mix and cover with a cloth or paper towel. Place jar on dryer or other warm place, swirling occasionally. Pitch when satisfied with froth of psudostarter, singing to the yeast, welcoming them to the world and a bon apatite. Place spunding valve preset to 2 bar.   


Post crash, add hops and remove at desired taste. Try not to drink too quickly.

# My Best of 2021

American wheats are one of my favorite beer styles (Oberon!!!). My very first batch was an American wheat extract kit with some steep grains. I've decided to make it a tradition that I'll brew one every spring to celebrate my brewing anniversary and the coming of spring. I name pretty much all of my brews after songs and named this batch Gotta Push On, jokingly called Gotta Push Oberon.

Name: Gotta Push On ([Brewfather Link](https://share.brewfather.app/9qopeLjvP4YR6L)) ([Gotta Push On by Griz on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/1PT03zQv9YRAYFt8BzgiSS?si=03a6cb18588b489e))

Style: 01D American Wheat

Batch Info: 5gal, 60min mash, 60min boil, Full volume no sparge BIAB

OG: 1.059 target, 1.062 actual

FG: 1.014 target, 1.011 actual

ABV: 5.9% target, 6.7% actual

SRM: 4.7

IBU: 34

Grist:

* 6 lb pale 2-row
* 5 lb White wheat
* 8 oz Munich
* 8oz Carapils

Hops:

* 1 oz Perle @ 60 (23 IBU)
* 1 oz Saaz @ 30 (9 IBU)
* 2 oz Hersbrucker @ 0 (2 IBU)

Water profile target: Ca 97, Mg 20, Na 34, Cl 124, SO4 101, HCO3 122

Water Additions: 4g CaCl2, 1.5g NaCl, 2g Epsom, 2g Gypsum, 0.5 Campden tablet, 0.5 Whirlflow @ 15

Yeast: Imperil A62 Bell's House

Fermentation: It was still April so my basement was fairly cool. According to my Tilt it hit 72F at peak of fermentation and then dropped to 66. Looks like on day 5 a threw on a heat wrap to keep the temp between 68 and 70F to encourage it to finish out. Gravity was already at 1.012 when I put wrap on.

Notes: This is the Bell's Oberon recipe and it was delicious. My tasting notes in Brewfather say ""This beer is delicious! Light yellow color, hazy, and tastes like warm weather. Light floral/orange aroma when poured. As it warms there is a dank/skunky note (light struck caused this).""  I really wanted to pick up a pack of Oberon to do a side by side but this keg kicked much faster than I expected and missed the chance. I will 100% be brewing this recipe again in the spring with no changes.

# My Worst of 2021

Belgian beers are a new frontier for me. I just had my first ones this fall and instantly fell in love with Chimay Red. I knew I had to brew one for myself to enjoy over the winter vs buying $6 bottles at the local beer store. This batch was named Tribute as this is not the greatest beer in the world, no, this is just a tribute.

Name: Tribute ([Brewfather Link](https://share.brewfather.app/5F3h99kte3LB2q)) ([Tribute by Tenacious D on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/6crBy2sODw2HS53xquM6us?si=67fd12b4a2984aec))

Style: 26B Belgian Dubbel

Batch Info: 5gal, 60min mash, 90min boil, Full volume no sparge BIAB

OG: 1.070 target, 1.071 actual

FG: 1.011 target, 1.009 actual

ABV: 7.7% target, 8.1% actual

SRM: 14.5

IBU: 29

Grist:

* 13 lb Pilsner
* 1 lb D-90 Candi Syrup
* 8 oz Special B

Hops:

* 1 oz US Golding @ 60 (20 IBU)

Water profile target: Ca 79, Mg 16, Na 46, Cl 111, SO4 82, HCO3 122

Water Additions: 2.5g CaCl2, 2.5g NaCl, 1g Epsom, 2g Gypsum, 0.5 Campden tablet, 0.5 Whirlflow @ 15

Yeast: White Labs WLP500 Monastery Ale

Fermentation: I let this thing free ride in my basement from mid October though mid December. I didn't have my Tilt in this batch so I don't know the exact fermentation temp but ambient was likely between 60-68F.

Notes: Only 2 months old at this point but not what I was hoping for. I get lots of the Belgian phenolics but very little to no fruity esters. Also a fairly strong alcohol presence. It is missing the toffee notes I enjoy in a good Dubbel. Next time I brew a Dubbel I'll likely add some Caramunich (\~8oz) to try and get some of that toffee notes. I think I'll also ferment warmer (70-72F) to drive more fruity esters which will also make my brain think it's sweeter. Could also switch yeast to a more fruity one like WLP530 but I think I'm going to save that for attempt #3. Overall it's not a bad beer but not what I wanted. It's already tasting better after a few weeks in the keg so I'm hoping time will do good things to things one.

Fermzilla Doesn't Fit in Fridge,"Hey everyone,
I was visiting SoCal over the Christmas and went to a homebrew shop while I was there. The owner was really nice and attentive. Got some stuff for a stout, and a fermenter.

As a solution, I thought of converting the fridge into a walk-in fermentation chamber by removing the door and building a insulated box to maximize the area that I can utilize.

A few thoughts on the iSpindel and questions about the Tilt,"In case you're not sure what these things are -
https://www.ispindel.de/docs/README_en.html
https://tilthydrometer.com/

So for a long time I toyed with the idea of getting a Tilt. The price (in the region of £150) always put me off.
This Xmas my dad (fellow brewer and mentor) bought me an iSpindel. Now I'll be honest, I'd looked at it online before and thought that the price was just too good to be true. That every pound saved on the iSpindel would be spent in time and effort getting it to work. How terribly wrong I was.
Initially the setup looked a little technical and daunting, but I went through some simple steps and then suddenly I was done!
The user interface isn't pretty, but it's usable, even on a phone.
I had a little difficulty with WiFi signal, so had to use a booster, but that's to be expected - the things in a bucket of liquid in an insulated cupboard in the garage.
I also used the default calibration, so the SG reading is a little off. But I will go through the process of calibrating it manually when I get a chance.
Once set up it's linked to a website called Ubidots. I'd never heard of it, but it does a grand job. Once you set it up you can create a little shortcut on your phone that takes you straight to your ""dashboard"" which shows you the data collected over the past 24hrs. I've got 2 little graphs, one for temperature and one for gravity. Over the past 24hrs I can see that my brew cupboard has stayed at a nice stable temperature and my brew has dropped 0.010. Fermentation is well under way.

In hindsight I don't know why I ever doubted the ingenuity of the homebrew community. The iSpindel is awesome and if you have even basic computer literacy, I'd recommend one. I'll probably buy another to pop in my second fermenter.

If anyone has the Tilt I'd be really interested to know if it has some other functionality that the iSpindel is missing? Does it have improved battery life or WiFi signal? Does it provide other data such as acidity? Is it just easier to use?

"Being a member of multiple Homebrewing Clubs: poor form, or OK?","I've been fumbling my way through the first \~5 months of homebrewing on my own, and am looking to join a local homebrewing club in the next few months. I am equidistant between two decently-sized, well-run clubs.

Ideally, I would like to join both. I figure, the more people I meet, the more events I go to and take part of, the richer my homebrewing knowledge will become.

However I'm aware that it might be considered ""bad etiquette"" to join multiple clubs. For years now I've been involved with a sport where clubs are pretty territorial and being a member of both would be a major faux pas. Is the same true with brew clubs? Or is being a good-standing member of multiple clubs a typical thing?",Homebrewing
"Open fermentations: staling, yeast and cooling, by example","I'm interested in open fermentations; they seem so counter-intuitive to everything I've read so far. I have a few related questions that I haven't been able to find answers for and was hoping anyone with open fermentation experience might be able to shed some light:

1. Wouldn't oxygenation and staling (shelf-life destabilization) become a predominant issue in open fermented beers?
2. From what I've seen/read so far, the yeast seem to go dormant a lot in open fermentations and need constant rousing. Wondering if this is true and if so, why?
3. A lot of the homebrew setups I've seen just rely solely on a coolship to cool the boiled wort. My understanding of the cooling process is that its critical to rapidly cool the boiled wort as fast as possible so that you get a clean cold break and -- more importantly -- you volatilize out all the DMS built up by the boil. So wouldn't it make more sense to: (1) boil, (2) cool rapidly using typical methods like immesion chiller, etc., and then (3) transfer to a coolship for open fermentation?

Thanks in advance for any course correction/steering on this.",Homebrewing
What was I doing again? West coast IPA advice.,"So…I’m not a big IPA person but I like old school lagunitas, and I have had good luck with making pale ales with cascade and Amarillo. A buddy of mine wants to brew an IPA and I puzzled out a 2 oz 6.2 AA cascade and 3 oz 8 AA Amarillo pellet 5.5 Gal. recipe but now I’ve lost it. Batch was a 6% abv goal and I’m sure I meant to do cascade for bittering and @15m and Amarillo for @15m and @whirlpool. I hadn’t planned to dry hop as I’m interested in making a more classic West Coast style. It has some carafoam and a little C40 in the malt profile for reference. Since I have to work backwards I figured It would be fun to ask what hop schedule others might recommend? Goal is 55-60 IBU.

Just sharing: Finally (nearly) hit all my numbers (+ a question),"Brewing 4 years in Jan, and on brew # 52 this Dec, I nearly hit ever number I calculated (via Brewers Friend) for a 'Chocolate Cherry Porter' recipe I whipped up.  Not that my goal is to hit numbers, but it's nice.  Up until now, 'stuff has been all over the place' lol.  Still make tasty beer though ;) 

&amp;#x200B;

* Mash Temp : calc 153, real 150 (This is the one main outlier, so I'll list it first: I forgot to pre-heat my mash tun enough, lesson learned.  Yah, I could have added more hot water, but RDWHAHB).
* Mash pH : calc 5.36, real 5.33 (based on a water test that day + salt additions).
* Post mash gravity: calc 1.055, real 1.054
* OG : calc 1.067, real 1.067
   * I did get more wort out of the mash tun than expected (batch sparge), so I adjusted my boil time by 20 min which helped make hit the OG (and final volume) right on.
* FG : calc 1.015, real 1.017
* Attenuation : calc 77% for Lallemand Nottingham, real 74%
* ABV : cal 6.89%, real 6.57%
* Total bottled : calc 5 gal, real \~5 gal.

This now my fourth batch on a pretty straight forward all grain 3 vessel system (this batch had 75% mash efficiency).  It's currently bottle conditioning, but it tasted pretty great on bottle day.

It's been a hardware journey to get here: Extract -&gt; BIAB -&gt; K-RIMS -&gt; 3-vessel.  BIAB was always a crap-shoot it seemed.  I was having nothing but issues with my K-RIMS setup (recirculation, and thus temp always seemed to be a weak point in thick mashes, even if I threw bags of rice hulls at it), so just decided to 'go back to basics' with the 3-vessel, and 'what do you know' : It's just easier, takes less time, and I'm hitting numbers really well (for anyone else just starting out:  Just go 3-vessel...).

**QUESTION** 

**How to help the attenuation?**  Since it was a little high, the ABV was a bit low (vs the calculated FG value).  Used two packs dry Nottingham yeast (per the Lallemand yeast calculator). 

I also added add 64 oz of cherry puree into secondary, which reactivated the yeast nicely (track it all with a Tilt).

In general, unless I go for a lower mash temp and add in extra sugars to dry things out, I always feel like I'm under-attenuating more than I'd like. 

* More wort aeration?  
   * Doing a good bit of research (just google 'aerate wort dry yeast'), the manufacturers generally state you *don't* need to aerate the wort before pitching *dry* yeast: Modern production processes give them 'everything they need' to do the job.  
   * That being said, I do use an aeration nozzle on the end of my racking hose, so it gets sprayed out in a fan maximizing surface area during the transfer. 
   * I used to use an aquarium pump / oxygen stone for 20 min, but I didn't notice much difference.
   * Because Christmas:  I do have an O2 stone/wand coming in to see if this helps.
* What else?

Happy New Year everyone.",Homebrewing

What a lazy man has learned about brewing,[removed],Homebrewing
2021 Homebrewing: My year in review,"What a year! This post goes out as a tribute and a huge thank you to this community and the constant growth and positivity that comes out of it. I've been brewing for a little over a decade with some breaks along the way. After a less-than-motivating 2020, I decided to really get back into the hobby in 2021. It wouldn't have been as successful without the support and conversations here.

In years past, I was lucky if I brewed 4-5 batches. This year, I brewed [20 batches](https://i.imgur.com/HuZKoHv.png). This was made possible by 'right-sizing' my brew day down to 3 gallons and doing BIAB right on my kitchen stovetop, beginning to ferment in corny kegs, getting a dedicated fermentation space, and adding extra taps to my keezer.

My state has 3 AHA sanctioned competitions. It was my first time participating, and I entered 10 beers between the 3 competitions, with 3 beers placing at their tables. Getting recognition is nice, but the objective feedback and scoresheets make the competitions so worth it. I actively look forward to reading what the judges write and improving my technique.

A big thanks to u/homebrewfinds for hosting [my article](https://www.homebrewfinds.com/2021/09/adding-a-tri-clamp-fitting-to-a-homebrew-keg-lid.html) and allowing me to share my experimental project adding a tri-clamp fitting to a corny keg lid. It was a fun project to try and has been a nice addition to use with the oxygen-free dry hopper I pieced together.

There was one piece of bad news this year. My LHBS closed down since the owner is retiring after 30+ years in the business. I learned and grew so much over the years from conversations there. I think I have found an online alternative that will be good for me, but I couldn't imagine starting to homebrew now without the LHBS to stop in, call, email, etc whenever I needed some clarification.

But it is now onward and upward for 2022! My goal is to brew 22 for 2022, entering 12-15 of them for competition feedback. The first 8 are already planned in Brewfather.

If you're a new brewer here, keep going, keep experimenting, ask questions, get feedback, and RDWHAHB!

Cheers, r/homebrewing! Here's to a safe, healthy, and happy 2022!",Homebrewing
This was my year in beer,"Altbier. Seriously guys do even altbier? I hope its Alt like the tattooed ladies that show off their squidger on suicicegirls rather than Alt like kahki trousers and racism. I also Mexican lager. It's like American lager but from Mexico. But instead of adding American hops (hops) they add something different like rice or Tex mex or something. The bready biscuits are darker so the beer tastes more different. So Mexico but also from Venice.

A friend said Mexican lagers had rice but I told him just the hulls. Just toss em in at the end of the boil. Never had an issue. Never had a stuck mash. Just a handful no matter what volume you brew.

I forgot to add beer to my no rinse sanitizer... is it ruined?

Also made an American pseudo lager. This is when you put American hops (usually known as hops) and ultrarare Scandiblatavian Kveik yeast in it. I know that the yeast is like from foreign in Blatscandia but this was not a Scandablovian lager as it had American hops in it (hops) so it was from American.

I cooled it to 1° Kelvin then let it free rise to only a few degrees cooler than the suns surface. Never had a problem. Best beer I've made and I brew twice a day. Wife and kid understand.

Is it infected? From another angle.

Fruit. The final fruitier. These are the voyages of the starfruit Ekuanot. Its five-day fermentation brew to bottle: to explore strange new fruits. To seek out new fruits and new ways of adding fruit. To boldly go where no fruit has gone before! So I got a half ton of fruit™ from some store like a buck for the entire GDP of some fruit island. Just tossed it in. Metal. Fruit. Paper. Just tossed it in. Never had an issue. Made a Fruit flavoured American Fruit box milkshake pumpkin spice latte creamed cream pie pearl necklace cream ale nitro fruit cake cream horn jello hello jelly belly Danish Dutch pancake let's go Dutch, Dutch oven pseudo imperial sour soured philisour American black golden brown blonde lawnmower seltzer. Just like the one I had with my bros at a brewery you've never been to. Good guys. Anyone got the recipe but like is there an easy version that just uses two row and American hops (hops)?

My local homebrew shop just closed down how do you buy things on the inter net?

You've got to try this:
Two row
Vienna (handful)
Oats (not the ones you've got)
Biscuit (English? Belgian? Haha fuck you I'm not telling)
Floor malted floor boards from a maltster than only sells to my mate.
Hops (American)
No rinse sanitizer

Make sure you lager though. Do you lager? I lager. Biggest game changer I ever did along with weighing ingredients, kegging, using water from my dead granny's tears, kegging, installing an RO water system, kegging, sacrificing virgins to Baal, propane, kegging and adding American dry hops (hops) to my beer. By lagering I mean that I forget about beers I make quite often. Its the frostbite and medically induced coma from  when I brewed in a -29°F blizzard. Best brew I've made by the way.

It was an American Rye Lager that lagered in a dead man's heart that was previously used to make bourbon. I called it Rye Aorta. Naming the beer was better than drinking it as I fucking hate bourbon and only thought I should do it so I could talk about bourbon aged beer. Does anyone know where I can buy wine barrels so I can fill them with bourbon to then empty out and flavour my bourbon with beer? So borbony.

Can you make a coffee chocolate stout with an IPA recipe?

I still philisour like last year but I've been doing it since their first album so I'm a proper fan. Seriously though how do you philisour or add fruit? Like how do you podcast hops as some said they needed a bigger sample for their inbeerstigations or something.

What did you brew in 2021?,"I'm curious to hear about how much and what kinds of beer everyone made this past year!

Personally, my brewing was focused at just keeping easy drinking beers on tap.  I made 13 ten gallon batches including an English mild, Irish red, Scottish 80 shilling, and a wee heavy currently in the fermenter.  Two of my batches were pale ales that used only homegrown hops. And the rest were boring American bock, amber, oatmeal stout, and porter.

Just because beersmith makes it easy, I was able to tally up my ingredient cost for the year at $340 for ingredients and estimated my supplies (orings, tubing, CO2) at $60.  So I ultimately got to have pretty decent beer for less than the cost of cubes of Hamms.",Homebrewing
Experience with tilt hydrometer,"Using mine for the first time since receiving as a Christmas gift.  I initially checked in water and it read 1.000.  Made my first brew with an OG of 1.049 as measured (and double checked) using a glass hydrometer.  To my surprise the tilt read my OG as 1.042. I double checked with the hydrometer, drawing another sample. Then also checked the hydrometer in water and got 1.000. 

I added a calibration point using the app which seems to just add the missing 0.007 back onto the reading (while also
Showing what it thinks the gravity is).  After 2 days fermenting it now shows 1.024 (pre-calibrated is 1.017). 

I knew tilts could give slightly different readings but am puzzled. The tilt doesn’t come with a lot of reference material and only says to recalibrate when changing batteries.

"Pellicle on Kettle Sour while souring wort, should I boil?","For the curious: https://imgur.com/a/H9faPhR

Hey there, this is my second attempt at brewing a kettle-soured Berliner Weisse. The wort was made from 50% Pilsner 50% wheat malt for an OG of 1.046. The wort was pasteurised at 80° C but wasn't boiled at all.

For the bacteria I used what Germans call Sauermalz: 800 ml water + 100 g uncrushed pilsner malt + lactic acid to pH = 4.0, the starter was incubated at 42° C, strained and pitched into the wort at 40° C. The starter had a pleasant sour smell, no pellicle on it.

After 12 h at 40° C there was noticeable gas production (yeast contamination?) and a pellicle formed. The pH dropped to 4.7

I'm not sure how to proceed. Should I let it sour to 3.3, boil to kill all the bacteria and then ferment normally? 

Would it be better to let the bacteria alive and just chill the wort and add some yeast? I'm tempted to transfer a small portion of wort into a 5 l fermentor and boil the rest.

"Missed OG and added table sugar, did I mess up?","I recently made my first brew using an extract kit for a pacific pale ale.

This was a 5 gallon batch, I ended up adding roughly 13oz of table sugar directly to the carboy. I shook it up and retested it, and voila, I was at exactly 1.050. I didn’t think anything more of it, but doing some reading on the sub just now, I realized that I may have made a mistake by throwing in raw dry table sugar.

What temperature swing is acceptable during (peak) fermentation?,"This will be my 10th brew or so. The other times I didn’t pay attention to temperature but I got a stainless steel fermenter for Christmas (thanks Santa) and it came with a thermowell so I really had no excuse for the next brew. 

I’m using Safale 05 and making an IPA. I pitched at about 20°C (68F) probably the lowest I’ve ever pitched a yeast.

Since fermentation began it’s been rising steadily and this morning I woke up to find it was at 23.0 (73.4F) I’ve attached some ice packs to cool it down but I don’t want to drop it all the way to 20 as I’m concerned the temperature fluctuations are a bit too much and instead am aiming for 21.5 (70.7F) or so just so it is ‘more steady’ over all. Or am I overthinking it? 

I know the batch isn’t ‘ruined’. I’m already on the low side of the recommended temperature but I want to make this beer a success. Plus I’ve fermented at I’m sure 27 or so before and the beer was fine. 

Can’t RDWHAHB as it’s currently 9am. So I will RDW for the time being.",Homebrewing

Filter coffee grounds out of primary ferment,"I made a batch of coffee stout from an extract kit.  It is a 5 gallon batch, and I added 12 oz of coarse ground coffee at the end of the boil.  I then cooled the wort, and added my yeast and sealed the fermenter.  The issue is I added the grounds directly, without a mesh sack of any sort.  I am going to finish the primary ferment, and then I am asking for some tips on how to remove the grounds when I transfer to secondary ferment.  I hope the grounds will settle to the bottom, or float on the top.  If that works, I can siphon without getting grounds.

"Bear Butt Brown, a attempt at Moose Drool","After waiting a long time, I finally took the plunge to try a brown ale. Traditionally, I’m a big fan of Moose Drool, I wanted to try and make a clone by experimenting.

5 Gallon Batch  
 ABV 3%\*  
 Calc IBU 21

7.0 lbs Vienna  
 1.5 lbs Victory  
 1.0 lbs Brown  
 0.5 lbs Chocolate  
 0.2 lbs Flaked Oats

1 oz Fuggle; ½ at 45 minutes, ½ at 5 minutes  
 1 oz Hellertau; ½ at 45 minutes, ½ at 5 minutes  
 1x Wyeast 1098 British Ale  
 1x White Labs WLP830 German Lager Yeast  
 1x Whirfloc

Attempted to mash at 154 to create more body for 60 minutes, I suspect temperatures ranged between 157-159 due to controller issues. Mashout at 170 for 20 minutes. Boil for 45 minutes with hop additions at 45- and 5-minute intervals. Chill to 60F and pitch British Ale Wyeast after aeration.

\*Before pitching, I measured a 1.053 OG. After 2-weeks and SG of 1.032 three days in a row, I attempted to restart fermentation by pitching German logger after stuck fermentation at 1.032. Little additional fermentation took place, leading me to believe that my higher than ideal mash temp may have impacted the amount of fermentable sugars. As a result, I finished with a 3% ABV, far lower than my target of 4.8%.

Beer turned out great as an darker English brown; high mash temperature seems to have generated great body with a final gravity of 1.030, significantly higher than my target of 1.015. Beer is full bodied that is complemented nicely by the earthy Fuggle and light Hellertau. Beer is darker and more full-bodied than moose drool, richer but less crushable. 

Recommend that next recipe mash at 152F-153F after dialing in my system to maintain a good balance of body and ABV. Addition of German Lager yeast had little-to-no impact as fermentation was not stuck but finished due to mash temp.

Serving directly from a unitank,"I've always wanted a reason to buy a unitank, but could never justify the expense because I'm already able to do everything I want to. But after today's [discussion about fermenting in kegs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/rrd40w/five_benefits_of_using_corny_kegs_as_fermenters/) for a transfer-free process, it got me thinking: if I got two unitanks and a glycol chiller, and if I served directly from the tanks, I could not only skip the evenings spent cleaning/sanitizing/transferring to kegs but I could also sell my chest freezer, kegerator, kegs, and my old fermentors, freeing up valuable space in my garage for more garbage. I could even get rid of my counterflow chiller and cool wort in the tank, which would drastically reduce water consumption on brew day (sewer rates are extremely high in my area).

[SS Brewtech says](https://ssbrewtech.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002724503-Can-I-serve-from-a-Unitank-) that while the unitank is capable of doing this, they don't recommend it because of the potential for krausen and yeast to introduce off-flavors.

Math / Chemistry,"Any math wizards / chemists out there?

I’m trying to estimate my grain absorption rate. I weighed the water and grain in, and weighed the grain after mash completion. For the sake of this exercise, I’m ignoring the presumably negligible losses to evaporation.

* Assuming all volumes are 39.2 F (e.g., that a gallon of water is 8.345… lbs)
* Given 8.84 gallons of water (73.74 lbs)
* Given 13.75 pounds of grain was added to the mash
* Given that the grain weighed 18.36 pounds after mash/draining
* Given that the wort was at 12.4 Brix (corrected SG of 1.053) post-mash

I calculate the following figures:

* 73.74 lbs + 13.75 lbs - 18.36 lbs = 4.61 pounds of water absorbed by the grain
* 4.61 lbs / 8.34 lbs/gallon = 0.55 gallons of water absorbed by the grain (do I need to factor in the density change of the water? I’ve been assuming no, but maybe that’s incorrect)
* 73.74 lbs of water + 13.75 lbs of grain - 18.36 pounds of grain+water removed means my wort should weigh 69.13 pounds post-mash (are there other byproducts of the mash conversion that would account for loss of mass?)

If I try and derive the post-mash volume with the weight and density of the wort, I get 69.13 pounds / (8.34 * 1.053) = 7.87 gallons. But 8.84 gallons - the 0.55 gallons absorbed by the wort gives me 8.29 gallons.

I’m pretty sure the wort doesn’t physically shrink as it takes on sugars during mashing, so I don’t think I can calculate it like that. Since the wort isn’t at the saturation point for sugar, shouldn’t the volume be staying close to the same?

If I step back and assume the change in volume is negligible, then there is 8.29 gallons after the water absorption by the grain. If my wort weighs 69.13 pounds, 69.13/8.29 gets me 8.34, which is the density of plain water.

Now that I’m typing things out, it occurs to me that the weight change of the grain also accounts for sugars left behind, meaning a higher grain absorption than I had calculated, and some amount of sugar to be accounted for.

**TLDR** I'm trying to calculate the post-mash wort volume and the grain absorption rate given the starting volume of water, the change in weight of the grain, and the change in density, and I think I'm a missing variable or formula or something?",Homebrewing

Water adjustments in fermenter? At bottling?,"I brewed up a small batch of Dark Mild yesterday, using a mix of distilled and tap, while splitting my attention between other projects, like a fool. This morning I realized that I never added my water adjustments and I'm curious if I should added them to the fermenter (perhaps in some water that I've boil for a few minutes to ensure it's sterility) or possibly even with my priming sugar at bottling. 

My grain bill was mostly Maris Otter with small percentages of C60, pale chocolate, crystal rye, Carafa II, flaked maize and Carapils. I hit my expected efficiency and everything else about the brew day went as planned. 

My target water profile was the Mean Brews Dark Mild profile...

Ca - 54, Mg - 3, SO4 - 63, Na - 20, Cl - 59

Based on my calculations the water profile I ended up with (in leaving out my adjustments) was...

Ca - 15, Mg - 4, SO4 - 3, Na - 13, Cl -28

I alway batch prime my beer in a second bucket with some sugar dissolved in water but I fear this will introduce a lot of unwanted oxygen. In particular I'm working on improving hop flavour and aroma in an heavily hopped IPA.

How do you guys go about it? How do you keep your oxygen to a minimum?

I do not have kegs nor the space in my home for a proper CO2 setup. Once I tried to use my sodastream co2 bottle to ""purge"" the priming bucket but I didn't notice any difference.

For the details here is my procedure:

\- Boil water for priming, add sugar and let it cool  
\- Purge the priming bucket with the sodastream co2 and put the lid on  
\- Transfer the beer to the bucket avoiding splashing, although some splashing and bubbling always happens  
\- Gently pour the water+sugar in the bucket and stir a little  
\- Bottle",Homebrewing
Brewing in quarantine?,"This may not be a question for the thread but I figured I’d ask. I tested positive for Covid the day after Christmas. All major symptoms have subsided.

Yeast decision for russian stout,"Hello!

I am currently planningto brew my russian stout for the next christmas. I have brewed one for this christmas as well and i have pitched it with 2 packs of safale s05, and it turned out great but dry.

This year i want to increase the abv to 11%, last years was about 9.5%, and i want to make it sweeter.

I have read in previous posts that wlp002 is great yeast, but my problem is that it needs a starter which i have not tried doing.

First i would need to buy an erlenmayer flask, and it is cheap, but i would use it once per year which i dont want to do. Is there any othet method to store the starter? I have read in some comments that u can use a pet bottle but im unsure about it.

If i cannot make a yeast starter, i would like to ask which is the most suitable dry yeast to make a sweeter high abv beer, and how many packets would i need to use?

True 100% all-in-one with pressure fermentation. Possible?,"Alright folks, here's the TLDR right off the top: I want to brew all-grain beer the absolute most simplest way with the least amount of equipment and zero transfers from mash to bottling. What is going to be the vessel of choice?

I'm very close to this already with my inverted/converted sanke keg eBiaB rig that I built (check my post history, the details are in there somewhere). I mash, boil, chill (no equipment, just let it sit overnight), ferment, and bottle from a single vessel with no transfers. I love it. I don't clean anything until I'm done bottling. The boil sanitizes everything for my overnight chill and yeast pitch. BiaB naturally leaves lots of headspace for fermenting. Only 3 things I don't like about the system: 

- 1st is that I don't have a very good lid so I'm currently using layers of Saran wrap with a big rubber band (works pretty well, which is why I haven't bothered to find a good fitting lid). 

- 2nd is that my ""pickup tube"" idea of cutting the spear down so that it sits ~2"" above the bottom of the keg isn't very flexible and I definitely pick up a bit more trub than I'd like at bottling.

- 3rd is that I'm bottle priming with table sugar and it's kinda annoying. I don't mind bottling though - I have 24x 1L flip tops that I customize my batch size to and it's a pretty easy system. I'm really not interested in kegging simply due to the huge increase in cost, complexity, equipment, and cleaning.

So here's my goal for 2022. Build a new rig that can do what my current rig does, but add pressure fermentation. The idea is to do everything the same, but ferment under 15ish psi in order to naturally carbonate. Then on bottling day, bleed all the pressure off, hook up a picnic tap with a length of hose to get to the bottom of the bottles, and gently bottle via gravity feed. A proper adjustable racking arm would be great as well. It would be naturally carbonated beer with zero transfers, zero cleaning, and zero CO² equipment to mess around with.

So what do you folks think? At this point, my prime contender for vessel of choice is the Spike Flex+. I would put the butterfly valve on the higher TC port with a longer racking arm, and stick a ripple TC element into the lower port. My batches would be a bit smaller (probably 15L into bottles). Do I have any other options?! It seems like there aren't really any pressure vessels that can take a heat element. I don't really need a ""conical"" either - I'd be fine with stovetop and induction, but I can't find any flat bottom pressure fermenters.

A few notes:

- I don't care about the slow turnaround time of relegating my mash/boil vessel to fermenting. 15L of beer will last me about a month so if I get 30 bottles I'll be set to have 1 batch drinking and 1 batch brewing.

- I'm not worried about fermenting on the lees. Been doing it this way for a while and frankly I believe it leads to healthier fermentations and damn tasty beer.

- I have contemplated doing a single transfer into something affordable like the fermonster or whatever, but I really don't like the idea of having to replace a big plastic bottle every couple of years. I want this build to be lifetime.

- no fancy controller - just a SSVR and a pot switch and I'm a happy camper.

Help me (experiment?) recover from my mistake!,"Hey all!

My first real mistake after brewing \~25 batches.

Followed this recipe: [https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/7276/spring-klsch](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/7276/spring-klsch)

EXCEPT somehow when I sparged I added 50% more water and ended up with about 30L of 'beer'.  I'm worried the beer will have no flavour.  

I didn't have the ability to get some extract and in my panic I decided to toss in 1.5oz of Galaxy at the 15min during boil.

Do I let it ride and see what it tastes like or should I experiment with something? I would have the ability to split this into two 15L batches and keg two different experiments.

Brewfather,"Anyone around here use Brewfather? I have a handful of random questions, figured I'd post about it:

* I've been using the inventory feature to keep track of ingredients, and I like how it can track cost. Is there any good way to track ingredients for yeast starters though? It would be nice to factor in the cost of the starter to that, however negligible it may be.
* By extension, how do you track last minute additions? E.g., if you were to add DME to adjust pre-boil gravity? Just edit the batch recipe?
* Do you copy/edit your hops with the actual AA values when entering them? I know I can edit AA% on the batch recipe... not sure how this feature is intended to work. Do I use the typical AA% in the inventory and then tweak my batch recipes, or do I put actual AA% values in when I bring them into inventory? It seems like the latter is how I should do it, but it's clunky to copy the hop to enter a different value if I get a new batch.
* Why the heck isn't there an easy way to enter grain temperature right in the brew view so I can easily get my strike temperature? Do I seriously have to edit my equipment profile to update the grain temperature? That seems really silly to me. TBH, I just use a separate calculator, which is annoying since Brewfather supports calculating this for me, it just has a stupid way of specifying the grain temperature input.

Anyone run into any of this and have any thoughts/ideas? What do you all do?",Homebrewing

Brewfather G70 Clogging Issues,"I’ve done 6 brews on my new G70, and I’m at a loss when it comes to pumping my wort into unitank. The pump works great for recirc during mashing. But after boil, it just really struggles and I’m not sure what to do! I’ve followed manual about clearing air locks etc. The ONLY thing that works is bashing the bottom removable plate/filter. I have to do this repeatedly while pumping for maybe 10-15 minutes. Eventually it will run ok on it’s own. I don’t think it’s an issue with the pump itself. More like the bottom plate gets blocked, so that wort can’t reach the outlet. When it blocks I can’t even get wort to flow out through bottom tap, which is therefore also being affected by the filter plate. This happens on heavily hopped beers AND lightly hopped beers with little to no whirlpool hops. This is killing my beers because the wort is staying hot for too long because I can’t pump through chiller, thereby increasing IBU from later hop additions. Anyone have or use a G70 and experienced this problem? Any ideas how to resolve? My cheap-ass robo-brew never did this!!",Homebrewing

Fortune favors you when someone tries to strike you. You gain the following benefits:

Increase your Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you finish a short or long rest.


I felt this was a bit underwhelming and not worth foregoing ASI, especially once you consider the halfling's other racial feat bountiful luck.

I've read too that the issue is that the ice is colder than freezing and can ""shock"" cool the water. However, I saw another poster saying that keeping bags of water all around the cold plate does a good enough job and I'm willing to sacrifice a few bubbles if it means a more 24/7 solution.

Properly compensating for no-chill method?,"Howdy y'all,

Since my apartment doesn't have a hose and the sink nozzles won't fit with my chiller, I've been using a 20L water tub to chill my wort over night. The only problem is that everyone has been complaining that my beers are overly bitter, which they are. This is a common thing with no-chill I think because some remaining hop debris stays hot longer, and therefore steeps longer, resulting in more bitterness.

My question is: Is there a standard way to adjust hop additions to compensate for the no-chill method?

Like adding each addition 15 minutes later than the recipe says? 30 minutes later?",Homebrewing

Read your yeast profiles,"I made a saison 12 days ago. OG=1.060 got down to 1.042. The beer had the saison smell but a taste revealed the accuracy of the 1.042. I panicked, threw in some kveik (only other yeast I had available), and raised the temp to the lower end of the kveik range. After doing some actual research (after the new yeast addition), wyeast's site mentions 3724 can stall and to raise temps into the 90s to accelerate attenuation.

Quick reassurance on (possible) stuck ferm.,"Brewed our go-to coffee Stout on 12/4. Pitched a 24hr WLP001 starter after decanting to 6gal. Degassing with a blowoff tube, because in the past, this one has been **violent**. OG on 12/4 was 1.052

12/18 gravity is 1.022. We pitch another pack of WLP001 no starter, and add 1lb of D45 candi syrup,  (Typically this is added at 60m during boil, but saw a post here about going in secondary, so figured why not) and the espresso beans.

12/25 gravity is 1.020. This is good, because at least we know the yeast are still active and viable since the gravity would have increased from the candi syrup.

Any insight as to why this hasn't hit FG yet? Typically we're transferring to a keg or bottles within 2-3 weeks.",Homebrewing

Mini Keg Setup,"I am putting together a 1.6gal/6L mini keg setup, primarily for use in a normal fridge, but occasional portable use, and am weighing my options for correctly balancing the lines to minimize foam. I can't/don't want to commit to a full kegerator/keezer setup yet (space constraints), so drilling is not an option right now.  


Option 1: Create a small wood mounting block for the tap (something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/y0yP62g.jpg), but with the keg mounted in the traditional upright orientation)  I could coil up the hose and set it on top of the keg, or even make a few wraps around the keg itself. The 1.04 SG cider that is finishing would only need \~4.75' of 3/16"" line for 6s/pint flow rate, but I may need to alter the length a bit to accommodate other brews.  


Option 2: Dropping 1-2 mixing nozzle inserts like [this](https://www.mcmaster.com/74695A58/) or [this](https://www.chicompany.net/faucets-repair-parts-c-376_17_16/plastic-inline-flow-restrictor-p-3146.html) down the dip tube.  


Option 3: Get a flow control disconnect or tap.  


Option 1 would probably be the easiest/most traditional, but would take up the most room, and wouldn't be great for portability. Option 2 seems like the cheapest/most compact, but not sure if it would restrict the flow enough to get proper results with the tap directly mounted on the keg post, like [this](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WXqT3EPES._AC_SL1001_.jpg). Options 3 would still allow for a minimalist setup like Option 2, but would be the most expensive, with mixed results from what I have been reading.

Building an Echigo Koshihikari Rice Lager clone help.,"I absolutely love this beer and want to take a shot at making something similar.

What base malt should I use for this style, what type of wheat should I add to, ""enhance the creamy palate"" of the beer, and how much grain-to-rice-to-wheat should I use to create a creamy, malty, balanced lager. 

The finished product is very light in color with a slight haze. I'm assuming just about any lager yeast will do. I'm not sure if there is a common Japanese lager yeast that is commercially available. 

There is also almost no hop character at all in the beer. Any guidance on how many ibu's and what hops to use (magnum maybe for clean bitterness?)

"I brewed a ""sourdough"" beer with bread (no sourdough was used for the fermentation)","I have been brewing for a year now and I have had great success overall. Last month I remembered that about 10 years ago, I tried a wheat beer that listed bread as its ingredients. It was quite tasty so I challenged myself to brew one. 

As part of the challenge, I decided to not look up for recipes and to start from scratch. My ultimate goal would be to go to the local bakery, get some of their old dry bread for free in exchange for bottles for the employees. For this time, I will make my own bread. 

I really wanted the bread to bring something so I went for a sourdough rye bread, I just omitted the oil in the recipe. 

Once my loaf of bread was done, I sliced it and put the thin slices in my oven set a 90C for 2h. At this point the bread was rock solid and I transferred the bits  in a blender. I did not powdered it, I made coarse bits as I was afraid of stuck mash (I brew in bags). 

To make the recipe, I used brewfather and added bread as quick oats in the ingredients. I figured out that would be the closest to bread. 

Here are the ingredients for the mash:

1.2 kg vienna malt (39.5%)

1.2kg wheat mat (39.5%)

490g of bread (16.1%)

150g rice hulls (4.9%)

Mash/water ratio : 3.2

Mash temperature 64C. 

estimated OG :1.058, FG 1.014

After one hour, I checked with potassium iodide if there was still starch... And there was. I suspected that it was actually due to the bits of bread still floating. I took a sieve and pulled them down under the water. 15min later, there was still starch. 15 min later the starch was gone and I proceeded to sparging. 

At this point, I tasted it and the bread was really shining but the sourdough was completely gone. I had two options: kettle souring or using philly sour. I have used several times philly sour with great success however it gives quite a strong red apple flavour that I did not necessarily want in my beer. I decided to go for kettle souring. I have never done kettle souring previously but I had lactobacillus plantarum probiotics at hands. According to [Milk the funk](http://www.milkthefunk.com/wiki/Lactobacillus) it is a great choice for kettle souring at room temperature. 

I went ahead, boiled by beer for 15 min, cooled it down with my immersion chiller and inoculated the beer with the content of 3 caps (30 billions bacteria in total). It was a 3gal batch so I though that should do the trick. 

I wrapped my chilled wort with plastic foil so nothing would sneak under the lock to my beer. I came back to it 24h later and the pH dropped to 3.8. I took a smell and there was a strong funk coming from it. Barnyard funk is an understatement. More like the feet of a runner coming back from an iron man. As a french, strong funks never stopped me from enjoying food so since there was no sign of mold, i brough the thing to a boil and kept boiling for 45 min.

My hopping schedule was: 

5g Saaz 30 min

10g saaz  15 min

5g east kent goldning 10 min

5g saaz 10 min

15g east kent goldning 5min. 

I took a gravity reading and 1.055 but the volume was 10.5L instead of 11L. Close enough. 

I chilled the wort and since I didn't know what to expect, I chose a robust and rather neutral yeast for fermentation: Nottingham ale yeast. I fermented at 17C for 2 days, 18C for 2 days and when it seemed to be done, I kept it at 20C for 10 more days. 

I did use whirlfloc during the boil and I used gelatin to fine the cold beer. I then proceeded to bottling. It is important to note that in my hands, the bread produced a tremendous amount of trubs. For the 10.5L in the fermenter, I got a bit less than 8L. 

Here we are now, 2 weeks later. I opened a beer that I carbed at 3.3vol. 

The smell is milder but it really tastes like feet. The sourness is well balanced, the bread really shines through it, it is too sweet for the sourness (yeah FG 1.014) but the hoping is exactly what I wanted. Also, the beer is nearly crystal clear. 

I rate this beer: punishment beer/10. but this is only because of that terrible funk. I will pour it down the drain. 

Overall it was a fun project and since it was a small batch, it wasn't a big deal. In life, my job is all about troubleshooting and I will not admit that I am defeated yet. I think I am onto something. I will redo it, cut a bit on the fermentable, and use a french saison yeast to get it more dry. 

If you've made it that far in this post, here is the take home message: 

\- You can treat dry bread as quick oats in brewfather. 

\- Rice hulls are not an option in this process

\- Coarsely grind your dry bread but do not make bread crumps

\- Make sure to have enough diastatic power to digest the starch

\- make sure the bread is submerged and check with potassium iodide that there is no more starch

\- There are gonna be a lot of trubs and the yield will not be fantastic

I really like sours and I am quite disappointed that my souring went wrong. Maybe it was something else not listed in the probiotics? I was considering buying some sour pitch to get something legit. What do you think? 

Happy holidays and cheers",Homebrewing

Is there no way to serve a carbonated beer or cider without bottling or kegging?,"My brewing ""experience"" is limited to three one-gallon batches of mead, so this may be a stupid question.

I'm planning to make a few five-gallon batches of cider and beer to serve to some friends at a single gathering. I don't need to store them long-term. Based on the prices I've seen, bottling would be too expensive to justify. But before I go out and buy kegs, I want to make sure I don't have any other options.

What would happen if I added five gallons of dry cider and some priming sugar to a bottling bucket and sealed it with an airtight lid? Would it explode? Blow out the spigot? Would it seem fine until I opened the spigot and then shower me with booze?

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",Homebrewing

Stopping air and sanitizer from getting into fermenter during lagering,"Hi everyone! I enjoy making lagers, partly because I like sharing them with folks that think lagers are boring.

IPA Fermentation troubleshoot,"Hey everyone,

Amateur brewer here trying a new recipe, in brief I’m hoping for a little advice - I’m wondering if I should trust the beer gods or do anything to move the brew along.

My recipe is OG 1.057 (target 1.060) and my target FG is 1.012.

This was my first grainfather brew, but everything was pretty typical. I used liquid yeast for the first time. I aerated (possibly not enough). Recipe calls for racking on day 3 with 6 oz dry hops which I did while my lock still bubbling (SG 1.040). After 3 more days (probably should have made it 2), I re-racked off the hops (I did purge with CO2 to avoid oxidation). I did stir up a little yeast just to be sure I had enough (SG 1.030).

I guess I’m doubting I’ll hit my target at this rate. But is there anything I can do to get
Closer? Is it more time? More yeast? If all else fails it smells delicious Im just looking for tips to hone in.

Problem is, my last few beers have sat with the CO2 at around 8psi running into the keg for two weeks but won't pour a drop once I hook up the line out and open the tap even though the regulator is showing the proper psi for that keg.

On this one today, I took the line out post apart and removed the dip tube to ensure it wasn't clogged and everything was fine. It hissed when I burped the keg before taking the post off, too. It's almost like the gas is going into the keg but not into the beer.

Dry Hop Beginner Advice,"Have just started kegging and want to try dry hopping too now, previously just made kit beers. Am I on track with the below timeline for a kit lager with a small amount dry hops (10g) or do I need to change it?

2. Diacetyl rest for 2 - 3 days
3. Cold crash 2- 3 days
4. Transfer to keg and add dry hops directly to keg
5. Leave at ferment temp for a few days to a week
6. Filter to serving keg 
7. Put in kegerator, connect gas and leave for 2-3 weeks to carbonate
8. Drink

Should there be an additional step between 6 and 7, where the serving keg is left at ferment temp/room temp to age or does beer age sufficiently while in the kegerator?",Homebrewing

Should I pre-soften RO water or is that a unnecessary/detrimental?,"I'm planning on going RO. From what I can tell its the closest thing to ""continuous distilled water"" as I have been able to find (besides buying a still and actually making my own distilled water, which is slow). And I like the idea of distilled/RO/stripped down brew water, so that I can build it up to whatever profile my current batch needs.

So in my basement I have a water main that feeds into a soft water system. My two options: (1) Tee into the water main and put my RO system right off of it, bypassing the soft water system. Or (2) tee off a line coming out of my soft water system, so that the input to the RO system is already softened. I'm leaning towards this 2nd option under the premise that the softer the water is going into my RO system, the ""gentler"" it will be on the RO system itself and help lessen the wear and tear and maintenance on it.

But, not being a water chemist, and being of little brain, I wanted to bounce this off the community at large in case there's a good reason to just tee off the water main. I'm also about to make some decent $$$ purchases so if anyone has strong objections to RO itself or thinks there's a better way for a homebrewer to build up water profiles from ion-neutral source water, I'm all ears.",Homebrewing
Reusing whiskey oak spirals?,"I know this isn't beer so I'm not sure if it fits this sub but since it's about the aging process, I figured it would still be a good place to post.

Since I don't have a barrel, I was planning to use chips for the process but then I remembered I still have a couple of the oak spirals I bought a while back.

One of these, I used in a bottle of Japanese whisky and I was wondering how well it'd work if I were to drop that along with a new one into a gallon of port wine.

I know spirals basically become useless after about six weeks in wine but the used one only spent about one to two weeks in a fifth of Suntory whiskey which is 43% ABV.

Should I put both the used and the fresh one in the jug or just one or the other? Or should I just skip the spirals all together and go with the oak chips like I had originally planned?",Homebrewing

I have used Danstar Munich Classic for this and it ripped through the beer and ended at 1.007.

Contamination Advice,"I am looking for both worst-case and average outcome, and ideally a way for me to determine worst-case here. My plan is RDWHAHB

I kegged a beer and noticed the line I used was not ""clean"". There was something that could have been a water stain and could have been bacterial growth. There were black spots on either ends of the line, it didnt appear to be black mould; I cut open the line to observe. They were small chunks of wet matter that appeared to be sitting on the tub, not growing against it. The matter 100% came from the tubing and not from the fermenter, which looked and smelled as it should.

So, I noticed this far too late, the beer is kegged, carbed, and sitting in a keezer.

Bottle Priming Concern Re: Carb Tabs,"Greetings and happy holidays.  

I generally force carb and keg.  However, I made a Mad Elf Clone (never fermented above 72, fermented for 3 weeks, secondary for an additional week; final gravity is \~11%) for my father for Christmas.  I went all out.  I designed labels, caps, etc.  When it came time to bottle, I chose to use Carb Tabs in the bottles vs priming sugar in a bucket ([These Carb Tabs](https://www.atlanticbrewsupply.com/Carbonation-Tabs-250-ct_p_1481.html)).  I placed four in each bottle.  Bottles we left to their own devices in a dark area, covered, with ambient being 68-72 F on average (never quick changes).  Well, after 2.5 weeks, I open a bottle to see where they are and I get only a minor ""pfff"".  Further, the beer itself seems to have absorbed little if any of the carbonation.  

Am I screwed?  I have resigned myself to the fact that if there is a fix it may mean  the beer will not be ready until after Christmas.  That is acceptable.  What isn't is the idea that this beer may never reach its potential because it will always be flat :(

Our cheeky idea, because I absolutely hate having to remove the trub collector once it's on there, was to just have the tincture sitting right there inside the sanitized trub collector with the dump valve closed throughout primary fermentation. Once we hit FG, purge the collector, open the valve to get everything nicely stirred together and then let the trub settle as the container cools to bottling temp.

Does eliminating a bottling bucket have an impact on taste/oxidation?,"I have an Ss Brewtech Bucket and had the idea to bottle directly from the spigot into bottles. Now, I imagine removing the siphoning to a bottling bucket step is a good thing as it removes oxygen/infection exposure. 

I displace the beer with CO2 when I’m bottling, but is that overkill? There’s obviously oxygen in the bottles although my bottling wand has a low flow and really does a great job of limiting splashing. 

It would be easier to open the lid and stir in sugar before bottling, but I’m currently using carb drops as I use CO2 up top. I brew mainly hoppy beers. Should I just say screw it and open the fermenter up to add sugar? I’m just not entirely sure of the oxygenation effect of what’s in the bottles as I imagine it’s pretty low (they fill quickly and there’s only like 1 tbsp volume of oxygen in the neck) but opening up the top and stirring in sugar and letting all that oxygen in for the 30 minutes it takes to bottle seems like a lot.",Homebrewing
BRY-97,"Got 4 packets of BRY-97 early last week. Opened the first one this past Friday and was more than a little worried. It was about the color of a lightly roasted coffee. Made a starter to see if it was OK. Starter fermented well, so pitched it into a Pale Ale I brewed yesterday. Pitched at 1:30 PM and when I looked at 8:00 this morning, it had a good 2"" of Krausen and the aroma emanating from it was the normal estery goodness.

Thinking Lallemand may be using a new process or additive, so don't panic if you open a packet of one of their strains and it doesn't look right. On the off chance that the beer exhibits a fermentation problem, I'll be sure to follow up.

I am brewing a blueberry sour beer with philly sour tomorrow and I would greatly appreciate your input,"I started to use philly sour last summer and I really enjoyed how simple it was to make a great sour but also those red apple, mango esters it produces. 

I have had in the corner of my mind for some times making a blueberry (philly) sour. I got my hands on 1kg of pasteurized blueberry purée (92% blueberries, 8% sugar) and I am now ready to start (I brew 11L/3gal batches). 

I've done some readings and it seems that adding the fruits in secondary is the way to go to preserve as much as possible their flavors.  I have watched [this conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERrI0ktxRp0&amp;t=1537s&amp;ab_channel=LallemandBrewing) from Lallemand about how to get the best out of this yeast and at some point they mention adding the fruits at 5 days (so when all the production of lactic acid is done and most of the alcoholic fermentation is done). 

They also mentioned that philly sour is not suitable for bottling. I had great success with it but I never had to wait some extra weeks for it to sit on the fruits. That aspect brings me to my biggest concern:

Would it be a good idea that, after adding the fruit, to add US-05 to finish the job, let it sit for a couple more weeks and then proceed to bottling? 

My recipe is the following (I use brewfather to give me directions when it comes to volumes): 

1.2kg Vienna (48%)

1.2kg wheat malt (48%)

mash 1h/65C

1h boil

Corny Keg vs Plastic Bucket Fermenter,"As you fellow homebrewers are aware, we're always looking into new opportunities...masked as potential make work projects. Maybe this might be one for me, I'll let your feedback inform me a bit better! 

I currently brew 5 Gal batches, and ferment in a plastic bucket. Which has been working well for me, but my buckets are getting a bit banged up and need to be replaced. I also keg my beer, so the idea of using a corny keg as a fermenter and doing pressure fermentation lagers seems pretty cool (I don't have fermentation temperature control, only a 66F basement). I've also managed to locate some 6 gal and 10 gal corny kegs as well if I'd be interested in maintaining my 5 gal batches and not need to compensate for lack of headroom. 

So my question to you all is: Should I go ahead with this upgrade, and is the juice worth the squeeze? Or am I just needlessly complicating my brewing process.

"BJCP style guidelines ""release notes""?","So apparently BJCP changes up their style categories every few years.  To wit:  I was recently looking for ""Southern English Brown Ale"" in BrewFather but it appears to not exist.  I assume it got lumped in with Northern English as well, into either 13B (""British Brown Ale"") or 27A (""London Brown Ale"") but I don't really know which.  Southern English brown ale apparently used to be 11B (2008), which is now Best Bitter (2015), and used to be (~1999) Scotch Strong Ale.  

I realize it's all academic and not all that critical, but is there any rhyme or reason to these changes?  Are there ""release notes""?  Near as I can tell, Southern English Brown doesn't exist (by that name) in current style guidelines.  Did it get renamed?  Dropped as a recognized style?  Something else?

I'm not fixated specifically on Southern English brown, it's just the only good example I have at hand.  Just entered a recipe from Brewing Classic Styles into BrewFather for a future brew and... was kinda surprised when I couldn't attach the specified style.",Homebrewing
Making Scotch Ale more complex,"Hi guys,

Tartness in my beers,"I've been getting this tart aftertaste in many of my beers lately. I've switched out some of my plastics because I thought it might be a contamination with lactic (although it never really turns vinegary). But that didn't help.

I brew a lot with Voss Kveik so I thought it might be that but I'm getting it with other yeasts as well. It's really annoying me!

My brewing water is relatively alkaline so I've been adding some lactic acid to my pale ale mashes to reach a calculated pH of 5.4, but I don't measure pH because I don't have the proper measurement devices. I've ordered some testing strips to test the pH of the mash next time I brew.

Calculate malt contribution to total mash volume,"*(I know this seems like a question/rant combo and I'm sorry for that. I'm frustrated that I can't find the information I need to build my new system)*

Hello!

**What volume does malt have when mashed in and how do you calculate it?** I'm currently deciding on how big the MTL should be in my new system. I can't recall anything about this in the literature that I've read (which has become a lot during the years) and the question is rarely asked online. When it is though, the answers are usually surprisingly unspecific and anecdotal. A lot of answers tend to be ""I can fit this much malt in a container that big"", which isn't saying very much really. Especially since it refers to dry, unmilled malt.

I'm puzzled by how this isn't a bigger issue. I can't be the first person in history facing the decision of MLT volume. When deciding on the size, you can't just assume that malt has a density of 0 or 1 in relation to water. I've seen comments on forums where people explain how to calculate required MLT volume as just a function of mash thickness and the weight of malt, which might cause some awkward floods/dead space when they realize malt has a different density than water. 

Someone might answer that there can't be a rule of thumb since a number of factors play a roll in deciding the volume.But that goes for grain absorption as well and we still have generalized estimates for that. Even ""optimal pH"" is a complex question but we still assume given values. This applies to a lot of stuff we take for granted when being homebrewers.",Homebrewing
Small batch automated brewing systems,"Hi guys, I have a question for the more informed of you. I'm a homebrewer looking to do smaller batches due to less and less consumption (due to my body weight, and, wel,l not drinking that much beer anymore, but still not enjoying factory beer). Now, I have been looking at these brewing systems for some years now, but all I seem to find is that these machines (appliances?) are either an electronic mashing system, or a fancy controlled fermenter. As I have not got much room for my brewing anymore, I was wondering, if there is a kitchen worktop thingy, that does both, the mash with a custom profile in all grain (well, a small batch with extracts and and hops drops I can do in a  kitchen pot on the stove) and hops, plus a temperature controlled fermentation? I realize this is probably a long shot for lagers, as the chilling of the fermenter would be probably probitively epensive, but what about an automated ale system? Is there anything on the market? Batch volume preferably in the 5 to 10 litre range?

Or, am I condemmed to ""beer kits""? I have done those, I admit it, 20 years ago as a beginner, and some beers were not bad at all. But I have a grain mill, mouse proof grain containers for storage, and I know how to propagate yeast on my own slants, make yeast starters, and such.",Homebrewing

mash tun ideas including use as fermenter,"My current set-up is a RIMS: mash tun drains by gravity to the brew kettle, which is above the sole heat source and has a coil (sold as a wort chiller) inside it with both ends circulating to/from the hot liquor tank, to use the heat source below the brew kettle to keep the sparge water hot. Below that there is a pump with 3-way valves on both ends and tubing to connect it all.

My mash tun is an aluminum stock pot, roughly 16"" in diameter and 11"" tall, with a bulkhead fitting through the side near the bottom, and a false bottom above the outlet which consists of a pizza screen held up with spacers and a mesh bag over the pizza screen and wrapping the inside of the whole vessel. 

The biggest issue I have with this mash tun is that it doesn't drain well. The way I am using it now is just to leave the inlet of the bulkhead open with nothing attached to let the liquid collect below the false bottom and I ""get what I get"" while the rest sits below the inlet and goes to waste. The bottom is completely flat, with nothing to direct the liquid at the bottom out, and with the weight of the grain above I don't think there is even an air gap at the center, because when I clean it out the bottom is always wet.


Here's my idea: 

I would buy a new stainless steel stock pot that fits inside the larger old one, and has a false bottom. That false bottom could just be a pizza screen (I'd have to get a new one to fit inside the new smaller inner pot) and mesh bag, or it could be the fancy store-bought thing that is designed to fit inside a beverage cooler, but either way drill 3 or so holes in the *bottom* of the inner pot which connect to elbow fittings for piping that combines in a manifold below the inner pot which connects to the bulkhead fitting that I already have at the bottom of the outer pot.

In addition to draining better, this would give me a double-wall chamber with an interstitial space that hot or cold water could be pumped through to help maintain temperature. I could circulate hot water to help maintain the mash temp. I would insulate the outside of the outer pot (an improvement from my current strategy of throwing some towels over it). 

But, if I'm going to go through all that trouble of building a double-wall vessel, shouldn't I also use it as a fermenter? If I could get something with a sealed lid that would accept an airlock, I could transfer the beer back to the double-wall vessel after the boil and substantial cooling, then circulate COLD water through the interstitial space to get all the way down to fermentation temp before pitching, and to maintain that temp by moving water to and from an ice bath.

Anyone else make 2 different beers from this same grist / boil?,"I have gotten in the habit of making two IPAs at a time. An imperial and a regular IPA or maybe a regular IPA and pale ale.  Not unlike a patrigyle, but I run it all the way through the boil and the dilute.  I usually do something like a NEIPA, but a little more bitter.  I run a 9 gallon batch with a regular hop a small bittering then 10minute/flameout/aroma.  I then split 5.5 to one fermenter and 3.5 to another. The 3.5 gets another 2 gallons of water added (and sometime 0.5lb of table sugar). They are dry hopped individually and I get two similar, but one that is an easy drinker. My most recent made a nice Juicey 8.5% and a 5.4% slightly hazey pale ale. Simplifies the brew day and makes for a little more variety than a 10G batch of all the same.

I have also done a red and a stout in a similar fashion, adding a cold steeped infusion of dark grains to the stout.  Just curious if anyone else is doing similar brews and what has worked / not worked for them.",Homebrewing
Contamination or not?,"Hello everyone ! 

I've been lurking for a while, and know there are lots of guides and how-tos about spotting infections / contaminations - and i've read a bunch, but haven't seen anything remotely close to what I smelt / saw here.

I'm a few all grain brews in, and am enjoying the new hobby. 

Perhaps I got a bit overconfident and decided I wanted to turn out a beer before NYE so started off a Kveik (Lallemand Voss) APA, fermenting right in my stainless mash kettle (which seals with a rubber gasket and little hooks to hold the lid down, and I punched a hole in for my air lock). There was no air lock activity because I don't think the kettle was fully air tight... but didn't seem to be too bad as I could see there was a light pressure differential (water being pushed in the S bend).

After a few days at 35C (95F) I had hit expected final gravity, samples were tasting pretty good, so decided to bottle on the evening of that day.

Whipped open the lid to put priming sugar in and wooooaaa got hit with a pretty nauseating smell. As you can see on the photo there are some floaties that look (to my novice eyes) to be non-yeast based (at least the yeast I pitched). The rim of deposit left by the krausen is also purple (never seen that before??). I had another taste at this point and could taste what I was smelling in he beer. I had been tasting from time to time during fermentation and hadn't picked up this off flavour at all. 

Here's a photo https://imgur.com/a/g2vrbBj

So I guess first question is, is there an issue, and second is, if yes, what is it and how can I avoid it next time?

"How temperature affects pH, by how much, and why?","I understand that pH is affected by temperature, however I'm not clear on how to to predict or calculate this ahead of time. Is this possible to do? Or does it entirely rely on the chemical composition of the wort?

If its possible to accurately model how pH is affected by temperature, I'd sure love to know the formula. And if the degree of impact is a function of the wort composition, I'd appreciate a high-level understanding of what factors tend to make a wort more or less sensitive to temperature (as a function of pH). For instance, in some preliminary reading it seems that the pH of more basic solutions are more affected by temperature than more acidic solutions. So if there isn't a magical equation for adjusting pH by temperature, I'd appreciate understanding why basic worts are more impacted than acidic, etc.",Homebrewing

Reiterated mash and then split into two batches.,"I’m considering doing a reiterated mash to make a high OG wort “concentrate” and then splitting it into two ferm tanks. 

I have an Anvil 10.5 240v and I normally just do 5 gallon batches. I’m looking for ways to get more out of a brew day. I was thinking of making 5-6 gallons of wort that’s like 1.100, then splitting it into two different ferm tanks, then topping each one up to 5 gallons with pre-boiled and cooled water. 
I could then pitch the same yeast in each, or change it up to get two different beers. It seems like an easy way to double the output without doubling the amount of work.

Has anyone tried something like this? 
What extra steps or precautions should I be taking? Obviously, sanitization is the top priority. Also, keeping the pre-boiled water clean and safe till I add it would be important too.
For the hops, would it be as simple as doubling all additions?

Is 3.4 ml phosphoric acid the amount that I would add to the total 13 gallons of water, or to the 5.75 gallons needed for the mash?

Also, when I do a sparge water calculation from MoreBeer, it's indication that I should sparge with about 8 gallons of water.  

Would you recommend that I put the first-runnings back into the cooler, or just run all the wort out, then sparge the grain with about 8 gallons of water, and then collect that wort?  Is putting the first-runnings back into the mash tun cooler really helpful if I'm going to batch-sparge with 8 gallons of water?",Homebrewing
Brown Spots in New(ish) Keg?,"When I switched to kegging after realizing bottling was a total hassle, I ordered a new Torpedo corny keg from MoreBeer. I'm  3 batches in using the keg and I noticed after finishing up my most recent batch (helles lager fwiw) that there were these brown spots at the bottom. They kind of look like rust but I'm not entirely sure. I tried wiping it off with PBW solution and a microfiber cloth but they didn't go away.

I'm wondering if anyone has any insight into what these spots are. I imagine it's not ideal if they are rust spots. And it seems strange that a new stainless keg would rust so easily/quickly. All input is appreciated. Thanks!",Homebrewing

advice on how to build a double-wall mash tun / fermenter with a conical bottom,"current setup: 3-vessel RIMS: mash tun (MT) drains by gravity to the brew kettle (BK) below which is a pump with 3-way valves at either end to all pumping from the BK to the MT for re-circulation, or from the hot-liquor tank (HLT) through the heat exchanger (coil) that is in the BK and back to the HLT to heat the water in the HLT (there is no heat source below the HLT).

My MT is a large alumnimum pot with a bulkhead fitting near the flat bottom. Above that is the false bottom which is a pizza screen help up by spacers (copper tees connected with a short piece of pipe) above the bulkhead, with a mesh bag lining the top. 

I'd like to re-build the MT to get better drainage - the way it is now there is always at least a pint or maybe more liquid at the bottom after it drains, even when I lift the one end up so it drains towards the bulkhead. 

The idea I am towing with is to build an inner cylinder out of sheet metal, with a conical bottom so all of the liquid below the false bottom flows out of the vessel. I would build this inside the existing aluminum kettle, with an inch or so gap around it, so that water could be circulated to maintain mash temp. 

Then, I might as well use it for fermentation too, if I could affix an air-tight lid to the top with an air lock. The water in the gap could be used to maintain fermentation temp, and to cold-crash at the end of fermentation, then drain the yeast off the bottom like a conical fermenter.

Building the inner vessel would be a project - I don't know how to weld, but would be interested in learning. I was reading up on building a still and came across the kit by clawhammer that involves making a similar vessel out of sheet copper. I figure I could do something similar but with sheet stainless steel. I would definitely need some instruction though - any ideas for resources to learn how to weld and build something like that?",Homebrewing

BruControl UniFlex review/thoughts,"Early this year I purchased a UniFlex V1 from Pete at BruControl. It has taken me a little while to get it all going with work and family stuff, but it is all set up. I wanted to post a little bit about it for those that don’t know what it is and give my opinion about it.

Quick little background on me. I’ve been brewing for about 15 years. Started extract then quickly went to all-grain. First all-grain system was a single kettle using propane and mash tun cooler. After a few years of that, I switched to single vessel eBIAB using a non BruControl controller. I then adapted that to use two vessels. That worked ok but since the controller was built for single vessel, I had to move power cables and tubes around which got annoying fast. That is when I started looking at BruControl and the UniFlex.

Before I get into the UniFlex, I’ll quickly go over BruControl. Pete has described BruControl perfectly on the homepage of his site, so I’ll just link that here ([BruControl – Process Automation Made Personal](https://brucontrol.com/)). In my own words, BruControl is software to control anything and everything within your brewery. It can be as manual or automated as you want it to be. Do you want electric brewing with software that logs data but still want to hit buttons manually? You can do that with BruControl. Do you want a fully automated hands-off system? BruControl can do that as well. Do you want something to control fermentation temp and log data? BruControl does that too. And everything in between.

Prior to the UniFlex, the end user had to piece together and build a controller themselves. For me, this was a barrier to entry as I didn’t know much at all about what parts were needed or how to wire them all together. Pete does have great schematics on his site, but it was still a little over my head. This is where the UniFlex comes in. It is a prebuilt controller that uses BruControl as the software to control everything. Exactly what I needed!

When ordering the UniFlex, you have a few options you can pick from to best suite your needs. With no options, you can control one heating element and one pump/accessory. You can add a second element power output and a second pump/accessory power output. You can upgrade the SSR to a proportional SSR and you can add a DIN rail for wall mounting. And the last option you can add is integrated user input/outputs (which is needed to be able to control/read valves, DC pumps, flow meters, volume sensors, pH meters, etc). For my needs, I bought all available options.

If you don’t want automation (i.e., valves, meters, sensors), you probably wouldn’t need the integrated I/O. If you don’t get the I/O, the UniFlex will be plug and play. Plug in all the power cords, plug in temp probes (up to 10 total with adapters), set up BruControl with the UniFlex on your home network and start using it.

If you add the I/O connection option, there will be some wiring that you need to do (but I promise, it is very simple). Each device needs power, and you also need to wire the UniFlex I/O wires to each device. I found it was best to build an enclosure to hold all these connections. An enclosure will also make it very easy to add devices later on. Below is a picture of my enclosure. There are three block terminals. Red is for power, black is for neutral, and the colored is for the I/O wires from the UniFlex. I have an external 12V 5A power supply going to the red and black terminals. This is where the devises will get their power. Positive side goes to the red terminal and negative side goes to the black terminal. The devices now have power just as if I plugged them into an outlet. Now I need the UniFlex to communicate with those devices. That is what the I/O wires are for. There are a total of 20 I/O wires. 19 of them go to the colored block terminal (the 20th wire is ground which is tied into the black terminal). From the colored terminal, those wires are then wired into the devices. Wiring of each device will depend on the device you are using. This was just to get power to the devices. No worrying about what boards or components to buy and how to wire them. That’s all done within the UniFlex.

My review of the UniFlex – The UniFlex has exceeded all of my expectations. I wanted to use BruControl for automation but didn’t want to learn how to put all the components together. UniFlex does exactly that. There was some wiring with the I/Os but as I mentioned above, it is all wiring low voltage power to give power to devices, which was very easy. The build is very high quality. Nothing feels cheap or plasticy. No matter your brewing set up, whether it is single vessel eBIAB, single e-kettle with cooler mash tun, two vessel or even 3 vessel electric setup, UniFlex can handle it all. The big standout with UniFlex is being able to use BruControl. I highly recommend the UniFlex to anyone looking to get into electric brewing or upgrade from their current controller.

If you have any questions about it, I’d gladly try to answer them, but I do believe Pete is also pretty active on a few different forums. And as I mentioned, he is very quick at responding to emails (topnotch customer service).

"Significantly higher FG that expected, what went wrong?","Hey all, still a relatively new homebrewer, this is my 4th or 5th batch I think so far. This is probably a pretty common question but I thought I did everything to get as low of an FG as possible. I brewed an American Stout based on the all-grain recipe from Brewing Classic Styles but added some quick oats. [Here's my recipe on BeerSmith](https://beersmithrecipes.com/viewrecipe/3856496). I do BIAB for mashing. I tried an overnight ~12 hour mash and no mashout at 154-155F, which had dropped to 144F-ish I believe that morning when I began the boil (forgot to write down the exact temperature but was definitely above 140F). I hit the estimated OG exactly at 1.076, but after 3 weeks my estimated FG was way higher then estimated, ~1.024 corrected for temperature vs 1.018. 

So I'm stumped. I'm not sure this counts as a strong beer but it's the highest gravity beer I've attempted thus far, so I treated it as such. I pitched extra yeast, ~4g of Safale-05 rehydrated, oxygenated twice, first by shaking the carboy aggressively for maybe 5 minutes, then ~12 hours later more gently, and opted for an overnight mash instead of a 90min mash/10min mashout to hopefully increase fermentability. I don't have super consistent temperature control but I let it ferment in a cooler room in my house that kept it between 60-65F for fermentation, mostly on the cooler side of that range.

One thing I think I could have done wrong is the amount of brew salts and ph adjustments i did. I do have an old ph meter I got an amazon for fermentation projects way back, but I've never really used it and didn't have any buffer solution. So i was adjusting purely off the estimated ph in BeerSmith. This was probably a mistake and I shouldn't have added so much different salts and baking soda without actually checking my ph, I was stressing myself out a lot beforehand reading how extra important ph is for dark beers and how the roasted malts can affect your ph a lot. Since then I've only been adding a bit of gypsum and calcium chloride for flavor until I understand mash ph better.

So could it have been my ph being out of wack that affected the FG? But I was under the impression that ph mostly affected efficiency/OG and I hit my OG exactly.

It tasted ok though or at least not overly sweet, I was prepped for bottling so i just bottled it anyway with enough sugar for 2.8 vol of co2 and a little EC-1118 to ensure carbonation. Does that sound safe? The fresh wine yeast isn't going to ferment anything the ale yeast couldn't I assume and just go for the simple sugars I added for priming. 

Thank you if you got this far lol I know that's a lot, and for any help!",Homebrewing

My typical setup is what I'd call a 2.5 vessel system.

I wanted to give BIAB a try so I picked up a $15 bag and brewed a NEIPA yesterday. Granted, I'm definitely not setup for BIAB because I don't have a pulley and I made a bit of a mess trying to drain bag. I'm sure that part could be improved. But otherwise, the bag is a huge pain to clean, I don't feel like it really saved me all that much time, and it didn't really result in any less equipment to clean (I reuse my mash tun as an ice bath for immersion chiller and my 5gal kettle for miscellaneous stuff).

Need help with this question,"

Fluid Dynamics –   
Your brewery wishes to supplement its water supply by taking water from a local   
spring in the hills above the brewery. The spring is used to fill a feeder tank that is 2m   
deep, with an outflow in the bottom of the tank feeding the pipe to the brewery. The   
brewery is sited at 100m elevation above sea level, whilst the base of the feeder tank   
is at 400m above sea level. The distance from the spring to the brewery is 3.2km.   
Your task is to design the pipework that will deliver the water from the spring to the   
brewery if the brewery requires a volumetric flowrate of 100L per hour. There are a   
number of things you need to consider:

* Material of construction, diameter of pipework, and the absolute roughness
* Type and position of shutoff valves.
* Number and type of other fittings (bends, valves, entry and exit from large   
vessel)
* The pressure drop within the pipework from spring to brewery (both due to   
friction and fittings).
* Whether the pressure generated by the head of water in the pipe is sufficient to   
overcome pressure drop to friction and fittings, or whether a pump would need   
to be installed.",Homebrewing

Just a reminder to make sure your all of your shelves are stable.,"About a month ago I began a brewing project of making a Belgian quad/tripel/dubbel/single in the traditional method.

I rarely bottle but thought this would be fun, even more fun to make a second round of the same thing and try them in the keg vs the Brett conditioning.

"Help me diagnose my issue! Yeast rafts, pellicle/lacto, or infection?","
This is the first time this has happened in my 2 or so years of casual brewing. This is in secondary, I’m supposed to keg in 2 days (12/18). Took a look at the beginner guide of this page and I think it’s yeast rafts but I also see some bubbles so I’m thinking maybe lacto? If it helps at all it looks like powdered sugar, purely white.

Pressure fermenting with bread yeast?,"So one of the things I remember when first getting into homebrew was to avoid the use of bread yeast, since I was told I would get a gross flavor and the typical homebrew spiel. Couple years later and couple batches later and I have realized they where partially correct. However, some styles are ok with bread yeast, and then I started thinking. One of the issues with bread yeast is the flavor profile and bready esters, so I wonder, what would happened if you fermented a regular batch of beer, using bread yeast, under pressure? Would the flavor essentially be a clean ale? Could this save on potential costs with buying yeast? If anyone has done this or anything similar to this, can you give some insight?  I'm going to make a batch soon and am wondering what the possible results would be.",Homebrewing
I wanna set my kegerator up to be homebrew and industrial compatible. What's the easiest way?,"I currently have a single CO2 regulator that is split using a manifold with two ball valves. The way it is now, one gas line is corny keg-specific, and the other is industrial keg-specific.

I know, I know... I should have initially just bought a dual CO2 regulator but I was being cheap, and I regret that decision cuz I drilled two screw holes into my kegerator.

But I finally have the money to upgrade to a dual regulator, and I'm wondering; what is the best and most efficient way to set those two gas lines up to be interchangeable between homebrew and industrial?",Homebrewing

Chem student doing research into skunking,"Hi, I'm a senior undergrad doing a chemistry major and for my final research project (I'll be spending 14hrs/week on this) I'll be analyzing the chemistry behind skunking in hopes of, firstly, better understanding it, but ultimately to either prevent it, reproduce it, or maybe even reverse it if possible! 

So I have a few questions:

1. What, regarding chemistry, have you always wondered about skunking other than the obvious (it's UV, not temperature that causes it) 

2. My dad said he's had canned beer (Heineken) skunk on him, but according to the theory behind skunking it shouldn't be possible. Does canned beer skunk, and if so how? Is this just spoiled beer? Does beer spoil by any process other than UV skunking? 

3. Given that I'll be spending 14hrs a week on this for about 14 weeks, is there any research you'd like me to expand upon or any research of your own that you can provide to help get me started? I will have access to a few analytical instruments such as liquid and gas chromotographies, UV-Vis spectroscopy, Mass Spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, 300MHz NMR, among others. 

We have sonicators to degas the beer and I've already begun developing a separation technique to isolate individual molecules. I'm going to try to test UV exposure and then quantify the resultant isohumulone/MBT ratio. If there's anything I can look into for you or really any suggestions you have for me as to what I should do, they would be greatly appreciated!",Homebrewing
Acceptable Temperature Gradient in Keezer,"I finished my keezer recently, but I've just been experimenting with water/seltzer before I risk ruining beer or making a mess.

I went the route of modifying the built in thermostat because I don't really understand the need for the external controllers. I am seeing much less than one degree F swing (probably &lt; 0.5 F or even 0.2 F) so I do not think this is my issue.

I added an AC fan and have it running 20 seconds on 120 seconds off for noise and power savings (I know some will claim the startup current of an AC fan gets rid of any savings from duty cycling, but I don't buy that unless you can show me some graphs).

Anyway, I'm measuring 35 F in a gallon of water at the bottom of the freezer and 42 F in a separate gallon of water just below collar level.

I do not know much about this issue, but I assume foaming that others report from temperature gradients is due to CO2 coming out of solution in the lines since they are typically positioned higher than the keg in the keezer. Do you think I will have this issue with the gradient I'm reporting? I can be careful to keep the vast majority of the line below collar level so I would think it would be a similar temperature to the keg.

My intuition is that the gradient has very little effect on the keg since the temperature in the fluid is nearly uniform due to convection, but convection is much less efficient in the line so it is impossible to match the temperature of the keg for the entire line.

So that's where I'm at, I'm hoping someone with more experience can correct me or tell me I need to achieve a smaller gradient or give me a specific range to keep my gradient in etc.",Homebrewing
Kegged beer way too foamy,"I kegged my beer about a month ago and it was perfectly fine until my kegerator blew up and my beer warmed up.

Yeasty aroma that doesn't go away,"Hey guys!

So, I taste and smell all my beers throughout the entire course of fermentation and up to days 7-10 they always smell fresh and hoppy and exciting. 

But then after around 10 days post pitching the green beer gets this aroma that I can best describe with yeasty. Like the smell of a yeast cake on the bottom of the fermenter when you clean it.  

And I get it, the beer is green, but the smell doesn't go away even 3-5 weeks after pitching and I seriously don't know why. Sometimes it's even evident in the final product. 

I pitch the recommended amount of yeast, control the temp. , oxygenate the wort, watch for oxidation,.... etc yet still.

I brew high abv beers so don't want to wash the yeast after I've pushed it too its limits with a 12% stout and would prefer to run a batch of low abv ""beer"" with the sole use of getting a nice big yeast cake for washing and storing.

I won't drink low abv beer so rather than waste a bunch of malt and time I was contemplating boiling up a 15 litre batch of DME at around 5% or more and using that to breed the yeast by fermenting it out then washing

Need expertise on lagering,"I brewed a Czech Pilsner last weekend and I'm wondering about the lagering process. I've looked it up a bit but could use some clarification.

From the information I got online you basically want to store it as close to freezing as possible? So do I bottle it after a 2 week ferment and then store it to keep the yeasties alive to produce my bubbles or do I store it and then bottle it?

My garage ranges from about 8-12 degrees Celsius, would that be good enough? It's currently fermenting at around 18C which I know is a little high for a lager.

Anything I'm missing about this process?

I'm an amateur brewer and not a conneasuir, just want to end up with a decent beer to share with buddies.",Homebrewing
Newbie all-grain question,"So I’ve just started the switch from extract to all grain brewing. I had several batches of extract beers that turned out well before switching and decided to try small batch/stove top BIAB all grain due to my space/equipment limitations. The batches, even after carbonation and a few weeks, have basically ended up tasting like… nothing? They both have a fair amount of character malts and tasted “normal” enough after brewing. I think the recipes (below) were good enough. Both also had different yeasts, etc, but ended up with a similar bland/flavorless result. 

Two things I know aren’t ideal: 1 - I don’t yet have a mill so I bought pre-milled grains. Both were brewed within a week or two of receiving. And 2 - I hadn’t gotten into water treatment yet. To be fair, I knew the water treatment is eventually necessary but my water (filtered) seems to be fairly hard based on calcium deposits, etc. So i figured it would at least be ok. 

So basically I’m wondering if the lack of flavor could be explained by the untreated water, especially the possibility that it’s very low in sodium if hard? I plan to do the next batch by treating distilled water but trying to figure out what’s causing my issues. 

The recipes, I started with are here:
[Brown Ale](Brown Ale (Batch #1) - Crownless King https://share.brewfather.app/VPoNJ9v5WaJFvX)

[Dark Mild](Dark Mild - David O'Neal https://share.brewfather.app/7CZdj1NLvUCHsw)

Quick notes on the recipes: Brewed the brown ale first with low planned efficiency and ironically it overshot the efficiency by about 15%. Then I adjusted for the Dark Mild and it undershot by 15%. I realize this is probably because I used pre-milled grains from two separate suppliers that may have been milled differently (first Northern Brewer, then More Beer).

Fermenting and serving from same keg with floating dip tube question.,"I whiffed on my last NEIPA because of oxygenation, so I am thinking of fermenting and serving from the same keg. I had a few questions about the logistics though:

-i have a floating dip tube to use (with a little filter box attachment on the suction end).  Should I install this before fermenting? Or will too much crud get caught in it?",Homebrewing
The Great Yeast Heist: culturing a yeast strain from draft beer?,"So one of my goals is to make an **all** Sonoran Desert beer using foraged ingredients from the Arizona desert where I live. I have malts, adjuncts, even hops locked down, however, there aren't a ton of desert yeasts available...

But an ***amazing*** Arizona brewery, Arizona Wilderness, has a new beer on draft at their tap house called ""the desert yeast project, volume 1"" that uses yeast cultured from a prickly pear cactus flower. (The yeast was originally cultured by [a lab in Texas](https://ccyeastlab.com/specialtyyeastandseasonalrelease)... but whatever, close enough for me.) This beer tastes great, but is only available on tap, no bottles. I also can't buy the yeast anywhere near me (it's only San Antonio, it seems).

My question is this: **can I still culture/steal/smuggle this yeast somehow?** I've cultured some of Bell's house strain from sediments in their bottled beer (they even encourage it), but I'm not sure how I could do this from poured pints. Is there enough yeast in a dry hopped hazy pour to somehow grow a starter? Would it be too unsanitary of an environment if I covertly poured some in sanitized mason jars, and smuggled it home?

Building my first all-grain recipe and would love some input,"Hey guys so I would love to try an all-grain oatmeal coffee stout recipe for my 4th brew. The first 3 were extract, 1 of those being a partial mash. 

I've been looking at various recipes online and settled on one I would like to try. I went through and modified it a bit by adjusting the grain size to its a bit stronger, coming to about 7.3% abv:

[https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/1229031/oatmeal-stout](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/1229031/oatmeal-stout)

I've done my research and based off my last 3 experiences and well as other recipes I think I'll be pretty happy with this. But again would love feedback to make sure I'm going in the right direction. I also adjusted the hops AA based off the numbers off northern brewers site which is where Ill be getting all my ingredients from. 

**This will be a 1 gallon brew:**

* 1.5g will be for the mash, .5 will be kept for sparging 
* 2 gallon at the start of the boil for 60 mins, which should bring it down to 1 gallon by the end of it
* Hops: nugget for bitters and then willamette for aroma
* Safale - English Ale Yeast S-04
* will be dry-hopping 2g of whole coffee beans 3 days prior to bottling. I actually did this for my first brew and loved how it came out. Will soak them in a little whiskey the night before to kill off any bacteria.  

**Question on the malt grain:**

One thing though I'm confused about is which base malt to use. The recipe calls for UK pale-2 malt but I cant find that exact one on northern brewer. Would Briess 2-Row Brewers Malt work for this?

Thanks for taking the time to read everything. I'm pretty excited to switch to all grain. I love oatmeal coffee stouts so really wanted to try to brew one from scratch. I also like it on the dryer side which is why this recipe has no other adjuncts.

best sparge arm?,"so, ive been brewing for 7 or 8 years now. I was using two vessel electric BIAB, with RIMS tube and am moving to a 3 vessel HERMS system. 

as part of this process i'm just starting to dive into sparge arms, and trying to determine what's best, and what is a good compromise. i like building my own stuff, but am not opposed to paying for things if the results are justified.

i dont see a lot of commercial examples with some basic google fu, mostly just these:
 * [bichmann autosparge](https://www.blichmannengineering.com/autosparge.html) - which seems very nice. i like the idea of not accidentally messing that up. the toilet style flat valve is interesting. i'm not sure if one could build that at home though so paying blichmann prices might be the only way to get this functionality?

 * [The **Ultimate** Sparge Arm](https://www.morebeer.com/products/ultimate-sparge-arm.html) which seems like its better at not digging holes through the grain bed than the directed flow of the Blichmann model. i also imagine that this would be possible to build yourself if you were so inclined. 

 * various manifold style crosses or circles with multiple outlet holes for even distribution of wort across the whole bed. this has me wondering about hot side oxidation though I know people are less worried about that these days than they used to be. I imagine cleaning is occasionally a pain as well?

can you guys tell me about your experiences with various sparge setups? what do you like about a style? what do you hate about it? what is not worth getting wrapped around the axle over?

Fermenting in an uninsulated garage,"I live just off the eastern side of Lake Ontario where winters are a little chilly to say the least.

"Given limited time, should I lean towards more time in the primary fermenter after fermentation is complete, or transfer to the keg and let it 'lager' for longer (Kolsch)","So I'm brewing a Kolsch using Safale K-97.

It tastes great for this stage of the brew and is currently sitting at 18-20C for a diacetyl rest for a day or two.

My question is, is there any reason to let it sit in the primary fermenter for any longer than 2 days after fermentation has finished? Or should I transfer it to the keg?   
When I do transfer it to the keg, should I leave it at room temperature for any longer to let some additional processes finish, or put it straight into the kegerator to bring it down to a lagering temperature?  
In an ideal scenario I'd let it sit in the kegerator for a few weeks to really clear up, but I'm a little short for time with the holidays rolling in so quickly, so I'm keen to maximize the amount of time in the kegerator before the first serving if there's no good reason to keep it in primary any longer than a couple of days.

Adventures in glucoamylase and my path to cracking Japanese lagers,"It all started with a topic on Reddit about Japanese lagers (unfortunately in Dutch)... The topic starter linked to a page and Youtube video with some guys making an absolute mess of a Japanes lager. I never brewed a Japanese lager before but I had to imagine I could do better. It kickstarted me into drafting my own recipe.  


I remembered from reading Mark Dredge's A brief history of Lager ([Goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53017823-a-brief-history-of-lager)) that Japanese lagers use an enzyme that ferments down the beer further than other lagers. Asahi even markets itself as super dry. After some research I decided that the most likely enzyme to use is glucoamylase - most commonly used in distilling. The satchet was pretty cheap and costed about the same as dry yeast  ([link for those interested](https://stillspirits.com/products/distillers-enzyme-glucoamylase))

To start drafting I took Asahi super dry as my target beer: 5 percent ABV, IBU 20, SRM 4.  


Base assumptions:  
\- Malt base is rougly 1/3 rice and 2/3 barley (pilsner) as is customary for Japanese lager. Colour is slightly below Asahi spec, so I could use a darker base pilsner or add some grams of melanoidin to compensate for colour. I decided to keep it nice and pale  
\- Use a neutral yeast (W34/70 is a good choice) x 2pkgs  
\- Use Sorachi ace for 20 IBU (60 and 10 minute additions). Sorachi Ace hops were grown for Sapporo beer and not Asahi but make an excellent choice for a Japenese lager I feel

So I first drafted a recipe without enzyme usage and trying to maximise fermentability to get a base recipe:  


**Stats**  
Original Gravity: **1.043**  
Final Gravity (Adv): **1.004**  
IBU (Tinseth): **20**  
BU/GU: **0.46**  
Colour: **5.5 EBC**  


**Mash**  
Temperature — **60 °C** — **30 min**  
Temperature — **70 °C** — **30 min**  
Temperature — **78 °C** — **1 min**  


**Malts (4.2 kg)**  
**2.8 kg** (66.7%) — Weyermann Barke Pilsner — Grain — 3.5 EBC  
**1.4 kg** (33.3%) — Rice, Flaked — Grain — 2 EBC  


**Hops (23 g)**  
**5 g** (9 IBU) — Sorachi Ace 13% — Boil — **60 min**  
**18 g** (11 IBU) — Sorachi Ace 13% — Boil — **10 min**  


**Yeast**  
**2 pkg** — Fermentis **W-34/70** Saflager Lager 83%  


So the next step was to guess what adding the enzyme was going to do to this beer. My assumption was that it would simply make the wort more fermentable and potentially take the beer all the way down to 1.000 FG. That would take the beer from 5.1 ABV to 5.6 ABV. These are quite small margins in my opinion so I decided to not alter the recipe and only make a small adjustment to the mash to accomodate the enzyme.  


I added 6 grams (half the satchet) of glucoamylase to the mash. On the instructions it said that you should leave the mash between the optimal temperature range (50C to 60C) for an hour. I decided to alter my mash schedule as follows:  


**Mash**  
Temperature — **50 °C** — **15 min**  
Temperature — **60 °C** — **45 min**  
Temperature — **70 °C** — **30 min**  
Temperature — **78 °C** — **1 min**  


Last Sunday I got to brew this bad boy. It was a pretty relaxed brewday with a longer than ussual mash. Luckily I have a Braumeister brew kettle that allows me to program mashing steps. I tend to get quite reliable results so I dropped measurement after mash and went straight to boil. When I cooled down the wort I was in for a bit of a surprise; the wort ended up at 1.050 instead of 1.043.  


The glucoamylase apparently pushed up my normal 76 percent efficiency to a pretty amazing 86 percent efficiency. A bit of an oversight on my end but it makes sense looking back. It's only a good experiment when you learn something right? ;-)  


If the beer is indeed as fermentable as I think it is (fermenting down to 1.000 FG) it will end up 0,9 percent higher ABV (6,5 percent). I will keep a close eye on how far down this beer will ferment and if my assumptions on this end are correct.  


I'm quite excited to see how this ends up. Does the glucoamylase have impact on the flavour of the beer? Perhaps some other unknown effects? Did I even choose the right enzyme for the job? I fairly confident that I'm on the right track and will just need to tweak down the recipe for my next brew to hit the targeted 5 percent ABV.",Homebrewing

The brew looked very brown and gross when I first opened the bucket, so I held a flashlight to the outside and it lit up to look a nice golden colour. It does not look very clear at all and has A LOT of floating stuff suspended in it. I do not have a way to cold crash this brew unless I place it outside, and didn't use any Irish moss etc to clear during boil. The fermentation temp has been steady 19-20c. There also appears to be something that resembles cottage cheese on top, not sure what that is?  Pics are on post in my profile.

Alternative to keg fridge?,"I've been looking at getting either a keg or a fermzilla all rounder but it seems like when using these you typically keep them in a fridge.

I don't have the space for a whole other fridge or even anywhere to plug it in , I was wondering if there were any alternatives for cold storage / fermentation for either kegs or fermzillas ? 

One thing I thought was perhaps a cold storage box like this one https://www.amazon.co.uk/Professional-Thermo-Thermal-Insulated-Thermoox/dp/B00UPECJWI/ref=asc_df_B00UPECJWI/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=256204342235&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=3108519297221177034&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9045877&amp;hvtargid=pla-420139012546&amp;psc=1

Pressure fermentation at typical lager temperature,"About to brew a Czech Pils and plan to ferment in a corny under pressure. I’ve read that macro breweries employ this method for a variety of reasons, one of which offering the ability to ferment at higher temps and therefore faster/increasing turnover. I’ve also read about the possibility of improved aroma in the finished product as you are not blowing off as with a typical airlock setup. 

For those who have tried this method (under pressure, ale temp) Does it produce a comparable result to a typical lager fermentation/process?

"First attempt at a vegan ""milk"" stout...","So my better half has been vegan for almost 8 years and I myself have been for almost 2 years now and I've always been interested trying new things to brew. After looking around for commerical options and getting tricked by one I decided to brew my own!

Several options I found used almond flour and vanilla beans including Clown Shoes' version. The flour being used in the mash which I attempted and found myself on the wrong end of the worst stuck mash I've ever experienced. I had to use my brew kettle spoon to clear the manifold the entire sparge. This lead to a very murky wort that is off to a slow start fermenting to say the least.

I failed my yeast washing... Can I still make a starter from what's at the bottom of my mason jar?,"I recently brewed and IPA with wlp001. I was so impressed by the yeast that I decided to harvest it. I watched a bunch of videos and read about it in How To Brew by Palmer and when I was doing it, I suspected that something was going wrong: all the trubs nicely fell at the bottom but that clear white layer never came on top. Just dark trubs and slightly cloudy beer diluted in sterile water. Nevertheless, I decided to put the liquid without the dark trubs in a (sanitized) mason jar and placed it in the fridge. 

Here we are, a bit more than a week after, and I got a very small pellet of bright white-looking yeast at the bottom. I did succeed getting rid of all trubs but apparently nearly all my yeast went down the drain with the trubs. Can I still use it to make a starter? I was thinking making a 48h starter in 200mL and then add 800mL of medium to scale up the starter and be able to use it for my next batch. 

Normally I would purchase a new pack of liquid yeast but there is no local home brew store where I live and it is deeply freezing until march (at least) so the yeast will never make it in good shape.

Detailed Hop Water Procedure,"I've made hop water a few times now, but this was my first attempt at making 5 full gallons. Every batch has turned out great so far, so I figured I'd share the recipe here.

BTW: I decided to make a big batch after realizing how much I was spending on hop water, which was a lot! It costs me $9.00 / 4 pack at my local grocery store. Are you folks seeing those kind of prices where you are?

Anyway, here's the procedure (with notes):

* Add 5.25 gallons to a kettle
   * I used Asheville, NC tap water. I often drink our tap water and have no complaints. If you have crappy tap water, maybe add a campden tablet to dissipate the pool water vibes or just use RO water (though, RO will probably necessitate the addition of more brewing salts.)
* Adjust pH
   * I kegged some and bottled some and the pH was actually lower at the start of the process (pre-boil) than it was after packaging and conditioning in kegs and bottles. Long story short, I def recommend adjusting pH down in the range of actual soda water as the first order of business. Somewhere between 3.5 and 4.5 will be sufficient.
* Boil / add hops
   * If you want your hop water to be really bitter, you could do a long boil and add hops early to isomerize the alpha acids.
   * However, boiled for only 10 minutes, chilled down to 170, and added 4 ounces of Mt. Hood hops, which I let hang out in the kettle for 20 minutes. This produced what I would say is a fairly well balanced final product.
      * NOTE: If I did it again, i'd consider adding a couple more ounces of hops, just to experiment.
* Create a yeast slurry
   * At some near the end of or after the hop stand, re-hydrate yeast in a sanitized mason jar.
      * I used Sigmond's Voss yeast. It's clean with light citrus vibes and ferments extremely fast (see more on this below). It also flocculates amazingly well and will make hop water that is fairly clear.
* Chill hop ""wort"" and transfer
   * Chill down to room temp.
   * Transfer to bottling bucket.
* Pitch yeast, add sugar, bottle
   * Pitch the yeast slurry into the bottling bucket and give it a light stir
   * Add priming sugar (I added priming sugar tablets to sanitized bottles). 
      * Shoot for medium to high carbonation.
   * Transfer to bottles and cap
* Ferment and condition
   * After bottling I put the bottles back in the cardboard box they came in then set it right next to one of the heater vents in my house. This actually did a great job of warming the bottles up and they fermented very quickly. Voss is extremely heat tolerant and actually does better with the warmer temps!
* Chill and drink
   * After the Voss had done its thing, I popped the bottles in the fridge to chill to 40F and then drank! It's delicious and I managed to make 5 gallons for less than the cost of a single 4 pack....

Interpreting malt analysis sheets,"I just read Briess' [guide to malt analysis sheets](https://www.brewingwithbriess.com/blog/understanding-a-malt-analysis/) and had some questions for the malt-minded.

## Friability

Even after reading their description of it, I still don't really ""get"" what malt *friability* is, and what out-of-range friability values (high or low) imply. And Google wasn't much help either; can anyone help clue me in?

## Mealiness &amp; Glassiness

Ditto for mealiness &amp; glassiness. What is a mealy or glassy malt kernel? What causes it to be that way? What impact does mealiness or glassiness have on the mash or finished product?

## Turbidity

For turbidity it says: ""this is caused by proteins and beta-glucans that have not been sufficiently *degraded*"".  What is meant by degraded? Can proteins/b-glucans be degraded during the malting process? If so, how?

## FAN

Why is FAN analysis only performed on base malts, as the link explains?

Eisbock formulation approach - impact of perceived bitterness after concentration,"Question for anyone experienced in eisbocks. I've repeatedly seen the advice/warning that the concentration process of an eisbock will accentuate flavors (good and bad), and in formulating my attempt, I'm curious about how to approach the perceived bitterness. Specifically:

With my current recipe (helles bock base, along the classic Bavarian approach), I've found a good target with a BU:GU of 0.42. So, should I target this ratio for *pre*\-concentration or *post*? Will that bitterness change/scale linearly post concentration? If my planned OG is 1.080 pre-concentration and 1.110 post, to get the final product perceived to be 0.42 BU:GU, should I formulate my recipe to be 33 IBU, or 46 IBU?",Homebrewing
How do I achieve a higher OG?,"I'm finishing up my 3rd beer, but my first 5 gal batch. My problem has been the same across every beer: too low OG for an average beer. I didn't take a reading on my first beer, the second was about 1.034, and my most recent was 1.026. All these beers were probably between 2-3% ABV. I use all grain inside a mesh bag when steeping the malt, but I'm guessing I'm losing a bunch of the sugars when I take the bag out of the pot. I've tried my best at letting it drain for as long as I can before moving on to hopping. Is there something I'm missing? Like a way to wash the spent grains, or just let it steep longer? I'll have my recipe below if it can help.

Any guidance is appreciated to help me reach an average beer ABV.

1. 5lbs 2-row malted barley
2. Steeped in 3 gal mineral water for 90 mins (My pot can only hold 5 gal max)
3. Remove malt &amp; drain mash
4. 0.5 oz Australian Galaxy @ 0 min
5. 0.5 oz Australian Galaxy @ 10 min
6. 0.5 oz Mosaic @ 30 min
7. 0.5 oz Mosaic @ 45 min
8. 1 oz Australian Galaxy @ 50 min
9. cut heat and ice pot @ 60 min
10. Added 1 gal of mineral water for volume and cooling 
11. When cool, transferred to fermenting vessel and added another gallon of mineral water for volume
12. Pitched 11.5g of Safale s-04

Is thermal shrinkage actually a loss?,"I'm trying to understand **thermal expansion** and **shrinkage**; and not just how to calculate them, but what they actually are.

I understand that liquids expand when they get hot and condense or ""shrink"" when they cool down. But in a lot of places I see ""thermal shrinkage"" listed as a **loss**, in the same way that grain absorption and boiloff evaporation are listed as wort losses. So it makes sense that the wort expands when it gets hot, and shrinks when it cools back down, but the verbiage I've seen almost sounds like something truly gets lost during the condensing/cooling/shrinkage. Is this the case? If so, why? In other words, say you have 1000.00mL of wort at room temp. Now you heat it and it expands to, say, 1001.28mL. I would expect (unless you have any boiloff) that if you cooled it back down to room temp you'd wind back up with....1000.00mL. Is this not the case?

Also, as far as being able to estimate the impact of temperature on volume, are there known equations out there that anyone is familiar with? Basically being able to say: x volume of wort will be y at 90°F and z and 150°F, etc.",Homebrewing

Bragging About My Doppelbock,"I've increasingly been brewing German Lagers, but without access to imports or craft lagers here, I've been flying blind.

After a trip to Wisconsin, I picked up a New Glarus sampler pack that included a Doppelbock, they call it the Gyrator. I had the beer last night and, gosh darn it, it was almost indistinguishable from mine. The New Glarus had a bit more of a chocolate note and more German noble hop character (I like Northern Brewer for that ""minty"" bite), but it was definitely the same style.

Anvil 10.5 owner looking at 18 - Parti-Gyle?,"First off I love my Anvil 10.5, but brew day is like 6-7 hours for me and I do that day 3-4 times a month.  I look at this 18 gallon unit and think there is a potential 14+ hours of labor recovery per month.  My fermentation system is basically Anvil buckets and that would not change, so any ""big batch"" would be split between two fermenters.  Though money is a consideration, 'taking back' two weekend days a month might be worth a one-time cry; storage space for the extra gear is more of an issue.

I basically have 3, maybe 4, typical mash types....English Bitter, NEIPA and Pale Ale.  I am thinking of splitting the 18 gallon mash result between the Anvil 18 and my Anvil 10.5 so I can make two different hopped beers during the boil and cooling cycle; somewhat a parti-gyle, but these beers would be effectively the same ABV....I would not be mucking with different runnings and such of a true parti-gyle.  In short I like the variety my current 10.5 provides.  My kegerator can only hold one 3 gallon and two 5 gallon kegs; with two separate taps - one dedicated to a beer engine.  I usually rotate between these beer types to produce variety (bitter, NEIPA, pale ale, wash-rinse-repeat).

I am interested if anyone producing the same volumes has already done something like this and any lessons learned and thoughts.  I am also curious about considerations anyone in my same boat may be considering.

By default it does have some values in these fields so I could just leave them as-is, but I'm just wondering if anyone has advice I can use to make this process simpler, or at least accurate enough with the information I have at hand.",Homebrewing

Saison de Noel with (accidental) extra grain!,"This beer has been an interesting experience, to say the least. It is also the best tasting beer I've ever made, which is definitely a testament to Northern Brewer's recipe more than my fumbling brewing.

https://imgur.com/a/eUj8Yqk

I had a couple friends down in October for our first brew day in forever (for obvious reasons) and I ordered [Northern Brewer's Saison de Noel kit](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/saison-de-noel-limited-edition-all-grain-kit). Several folks here recommended it and it sounded delicious for the coming cold.

If you shop on NB often you'll know they generally only sell 5 gallon all-grain kits. Despite my supposed literacy I was *certain* I ordered a 3 gallon kit from them, which was perfect since my buddy has the smaller Anvil brewer.

Anyway, brew day rolls around and we go about making our ""3"" gallon brew, remarking occasionally how this seems like a lot of grain and is certainly maxing out his Anvil. We got it to fit though and as we waited I went to look up the recipe again to check something -- only to find, say it with me, NB only sells 5 gallon kits. We were processing 5 gallons of grain and syrup and hops into 3 gallons of liquid.

Despite my logistical misstep the the wort seemed fine and smelled delicious so we carried on as planned; no point wasting it now. I artfully ignored the advice on my initial post ([here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/qeexjp/brewed_saison_de_noel_5_gallon_recipe_at_3_gallon/)) and figured I'd see how it went, and thankfully the yeast (Safale BE-134 from the kit) trucked right along.

There was an astounding volume of sediment in the bottom and the alcohol had maxed out the yeast with a good amount of sugar left, so I made some experimental choices and watered the beer down to about 11% ABV when I racked it off the sediment and pitched another packet of the BE-134 to try and eek out the rest of the alcohol. By my estimation it finished back up between 12-13%.

It ended up being the best beer I've ever made -- it's strong and rich and has a delightful full body despite me watering it down. I cracked this first one the other night and was delighted that it carbonated at all. I'm sure it will be even better next time when I make it properly.

TL;DR Double check your batch sizes before you start your brew!",Homebrewing
Help with tangelo wine yeast,"Hey guys and gals, after completing my first batch of homemade wine(muscadine wine) I can say I’m throughly hooked on making my own wine.

Siebel Institute off-flavor vial will not dispense (help!),"I could use some help (quickly if at all possible!). I bought one of the off-flavor kits from the Siebel Institute. I have my 1L of beer to spike (Budweiser; its what they recommend) and just broke open the first vial, which happens to be a spike of a aetaldehyde (green apple flavor).

The bottle IS broken open and I can stick a toothpick down into the liquid. When I go to tip it upside down and pour it into the 1L of Bud....it does not pour out (LOL!). There's so little of it that it seems to be suctioning to the vial. I can hammer on it with a good ""whollop"" and get a drip or two to come out at a time. But man the main body of liquid just does not want to dispense.

So it has me thinking...am I supposed to put the entire vial into 1L or just 1 drop at a time? If the former, how the heck am I supposed to get it to come out if smacking it just produces a single drop at a time?",Homebrewing

Question re cold crashing and carbonation in bottle.,I’m brewing a NEIPA using Lallemand New England yeast. It’s been going for 7 days and already reached final gravity (1.052 to 1.007). I would like to cold crash in the fermenter for a few days before bottling and also need the beer to carbonate in the bottle.

Non alcoholic Pale Ale,"I've been wanting to brew a non-alcoholic (NA) beer for a while but never really got round to it. Last month I did and here's my thoughts/musings:

If you're looking for a like for like comparison with you're favourite beer style then you'll probably be disappointed. While NA beer can be/are good I often find it's missing some of the body of its alcoholic counterpart (commercial examples, that is). That was my experience when I first tasted mine. That being said you do get used to it quite quickly and the preconception of NA being sub par (at least that was my preconception) quickly disappears.

As for the brew day itself it definitely had its benefits. It was significantly shorter - 2.5 hrs start to finish inc. cleaning with less overall prep time,  Brief summary of the process as follows: use approx 1.2 kg of grain and mash at 72C for 45 minutes. Bring up to 78C for mash out followed by 10 min hop stand, no boil. Cool to pitching temp and add some maltodextrin for body followed by bittering hops which have been boiled in a small pot for ~20-30 mins. Pitch yeast (Lallemand (LalBrew) Windsor British Style Ale Yeast). Ferment for 4 days then dry hop and keg. Brew day itself was significantly shorter - 2.5 hrs start to finish inc. cleaning.

A quick note on the yeast - typically it needs to be maltotriose negative so it doesn't ferment any of the higher sugars in the wort. Also, while it didn't happen in my case people on this subreddit have seen some wild yeast get in and ruin their batch by converting all available sugars etc.

Happy to post the recipe details (adapted from UltraLow Brewing - https://ultralowbrewing.com/user-recipes-and-uploads-at-ultralowbrewing/) if anyone is interested. Came in at 0.7% ABV in the end so technically not an NA beer but close enough for me.",Homebrewing
(Humble-brag) We killed 15L of of my beer last night! My first time kegging and tapping my own creations!,"tldr - I created a recipe, brewed it, kegged it, tapped and people killed the kegs much quicker than I anticipated.  


I'd been looking for a good excuse to buy a few kegs and couple weeks ago, some friends said they were planning to throw a big party and I said, ""Want me to brew/bring beer? I'll even see if I can find some kegs"" And the FOOLS AGREED! The party shrank in size and was nearly cancelled, 

So I got to work creating my 2nd recipe from scratch and searching for kegs. I looked at the ingredients that I had, as I wanted to create a recipe without having to buy anything new and the ""God Help Me"" Pale Ale was born. 

I'm based in Germany, and bought two gravity kegs ('Bayrischer Anstich'). I had only 3 weeks from brew day to tapping it last night, and while the beer wasn't my best - it could have used another 2 or 3 weeks to carbonate a bit more- the feedback was exactly what I was aiming for when creating the recipe. I described it as ""boring, simple"" they said ""*süffiges, easy &amp; dangerous to drink"".* 

 It's an American Pale (recipe for 14L below), but very mild. Since it was my 2nd recipe from scratch, I erred on the side of caution/safety, and brewed something that wasn't going to blow anyone away with lots of intense flavors, but at the same time - create something you can just drink and enjoy. Low ABV - 4.7%, IBUs - 47 (beer wasn't bitter at all though, mainly aroma hops) and 10L on tap. I did take a risk as I had never brewed/drank anything with Mandarina Bavarian hops, but read good things about them and said ""let's see what happens"", and combined them with some Magnum hops I had open.  


After killing the Pale Ale, I brought out my secret weapon - 5L of a more intense IPA. 6.7% ABV, around 52-ish IBUs- brewed &amp; dry-hopped with Centennial Hops. Ive brewed this beer 6 or 7 different times and it's my best brew. While the first keg lasted a few hours, this second one was emptied in about half an hour with some people disappointingly asking if I had anymore hidden away. I even got an offer to buy a case next time I brew. Unfortunately I forget to take photos, I was too excited - it was the first time that other people outside my brewing circle/friends, ie strangers to me, ever tasted my beer!  


What I learned from this experience: My friends are great, they gifted me a typical, wooden hammer with my name etched on the side - I guess I'm a brewer now, I really like the influences of Mandarina Bavaria, next time I brew I'll add a few more and play around with the hop schedule - the orange/citrus notes I got helped create a more ""full beer"" in my opinion, and kegging isn't scary as I initially thought it was - although I'll need to work on my hammering technique - took me 6 or 7 tries. Have a great weekend, keep brewing, and prost!!

Style questions and recipe feedback (coffee black ipa or coffee porter? ),"Hi everyone!

I want to brew my first dark beer, but I didn't find a style or description that really matches what I want to do, I just had a pint from a small brewery and really loved it. I don't want to make a stout or any ""thick"" nor sweet beer, I am looking for more like a black IPA (but no more than 50 IBU) or a black lager, with a strong coffee flavor and some hop flavor too.

This is the recipe I got so far for a 20 liters (4.4 gallons) batch:

5kg (11lbs) Pilsen 2rp

1kg (2.2lbs) black swaen coffee (65EBC)

500gr (1.1lbs) black swaen extra (1325EBC)

30gr (1oz) of Magmum hop at boil and 40gr (1.4 oz) of centennial at flame out

Then I would add 0.4L of brewed coffee at flame out and 100 grams of coffee beans in primary.

Safale S-04 for yeast. That would give 50 IBU, 94 EBC, 6.2% alc.

What do you think? I have never used these malts so no idea what I am doing. I also don't know if that's enough or too much coffee? I also have some wheat, would that help? Would it be better to cold brew the coffee? would it be better in primary? Should the coffee grains in primary be whole or ground?

Put too much potassium sorbate in cider. How much is too much?,"I made a batch of cider and when I kegged it two or three weeks ago, I backsweetened and added potassium sorbate.

Today I have a second batch of cider that's ready to keg. I was considering transferring half of Batch A to Keg 2, then putting half of Batch B in Keg 1 and half in Keg 2. That would seem to obviate the overdose of sorbate in Batch A. 

Is it worth it to do that? I guess potential problems are oxidation and turning back the clock on the two-plus-week head start Batch A got in cold storage. (I'm planning to bring the cider to Christmas.)

"I'm not a genious, but...","This kinda looks like a pellicle to me.

[https://imgur.com/p0cDV7t](https://imgur.com/p0cDV7t)

I don't wanna be that guy to make a ""is this infected?"" post, so for background:

This is a breakfast stout that I brewed a little under 2 weeks ago. I found the recipe probably over a year ago on a youtube video that I cannot for the life of me find again. It's totally possibly that it was taken down for some reason. The original recipe was a Bounders Breakfast Stout clone that includes coffee and chocolate added to the boil, as well as coffee added after fermentation. 

The beer has finished fermenting, so I decide to ""dry bean"" with the second dose of coffee beans and keg in 48 hours. This is the first time I have opened the fermenter since adding the yeast almost 2 weeks ago. 

The first gravity reading also looked a bit odd to me, it had these weird looking bubbles on top, they weren't like the normal c02 bubbles you see when pulling a sample, they seemed thicker and more resilient so to speak.

[https://imgur.com/6iH7rdG](https://imgur.com/6iH7rdG)

I am curious if this is some sort of infection, or if it could have something to do with the chocolate added. The look of the bubbles in the sample picture as well as the fermenter look very simple to the bubbles you get if you try to mix cocoa powder with cold milk. 

I guess I really just want to see what everyones opinions are. So far the beer smells and tastes fine, it doesn't have an abnormally low FG, or any of what I would expect from something that got infected. As a matter of fact, it smells and tastes pretty damn good in my honest opinion. I still plan to keg and carb it up, worst case scenario at this point I have to dump it. If there's interest I can report back for sure after it's carbed and on tap.

I can post the recipe and specs on the brew if anyone thinks that would be useful, just don't have access to brewfather at the moment.",Homebrewing

Beer went bad while bottling?,"First batch, and it was a honey blonde ale. Tried it when I was taking a sample to get the ABV via gas chromatography and it tasted good, just a little watered down but otherwise good flavor and I expected carbonation to improve it. I believe I used Lalvin 71B to bottle with… I just went with what the person at my brew shop recommended. Gave it a week to condition in bottle at ~68-70 degrees. Just cracked one open tonight and I think it went bad. Kind of a sharp sour fruity smell right off the bat which is completely new. Before bottling, it smelled how a blonde/medium ale should smell and had a honey at the end. The taste isn’t exactly great either. Still sort of watery with little malt flavor and mostly a more pronounced honey with the same fruity taste (I’m not really sure how to describe it but it’s not sour and I am pretty meticulous ab sanitation so I don’t think I contaminated it). Any ideas? My thoughts are the 71B started fermenting the honey sugars that my ale yeast couldn’t almost making a Meade while bottling and already ran through the priming sugar, or I just opened too soon and am getting fermentation by-products and if I give it another week or 2 it’ll be cleaned up.",Homebrewing
Diacetyl with wlp002,"I’m inherently impatient so apologies in advance if this is simply a case of me rushing. 

I brewed my annual Christmas ale recently (OG 1.090 before 1lb of honey in primary) and decided to go with wlp002 to try something a little different this year. I brewed a dark mild prior to and racked this batch straight on that yeast cake. I had zero issues with the dark mild and a very vigorous fermentation on the Christmas ale. 

Its been steady at FG for 5 days now and this beer is still a butter bomb. I know this yeast is notorious for floccing out so I’ve got it held at 70 degrees and I’ve been rousing it at least a couple times a day. I last tasted it two days ago and I will say today’s sample
Is better but the diacetyl is still quite noticeable. Does my current plan of rousing have a chance to work or do I need to get some actively fermenting yeast in there?

Also my fermenter is pressurized and I can pull samples without oxygen exposure so don’t freak out about me tasting it too much lol. 

TLDR: high gravity beer fermented with wlp002 still has very noticeable diacetyl 5 days after FG. Help.",Homebrewing
Lost Taste/Smell,"I know this has probably been discussed before but I lost my sense of taste and smell yesterday (waiting on COVID results) and recently really started getting back into homebrewing and just started cider making before this. I had a beer from my last batch which was Blackberry Milkshake IPA from NB. I was at least able to taste it after it fully conditioned before I lost my senses and it was fantastic! I tried it today, my first full day after losing my taste/smell. I can taste basic things like salty, sweet, etc.. But other than that, no hop character, malt, etc... I just want to hear other experiences people may have had similar to mine. The future looks bleak for me and homebrewing if this doesn't recover soon. I can rely on my wife to help me with flavors and smells but it seems kinda pointless to brew if I can't taste. I'm actually kinda depressed about it since homebrewing was the one hobby I really stuck with and enjoy.

Anyway, not to bum everyone out but I need a lift today.

"Sensory analysis of malts and hops, by example","So I've been meaning to do a ""sensory day"" with malts and hops instead of a normal brew day. A day where I sample a wide variety of malts and hops and get familiar with their aromas and flavors. On a whim I stopped by my local homebrew shop this afternoon and bough a bunch of 3oz baggies of various base and specialty malts and 7 or 8 different types of hops.

Any suggestions on what I can do with these to really get to know them? Again I'm **not** looking to brew, I'm looking to sample these so I can understand what they bring to the table. Maybe mill the malts and then boil up a gallon or two of water and ""mash"" the grists individually in mason jars? Chew on them, smell them? For the hops (all pellets), maybe roll them in my hand and see what aromas they give off?

How to get more effervescence or crispness from this very simple recipe?,"This is probably a step back from what the sub is used to and probably a little silly too, but I began watching a Youtube channel called [Townsends](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxr2d4As312LulcajAkKJYw) where the host tries out recipes from the 17th and 18th centuries. One of his recipes was for [18th century ginger beer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfnHCdc3BgA) and it seemed rather easy so I wanted to try it, but I hate ginger so I tried it with apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove instead. I wasn't excepting much for an 18th century recipe but I really would like to expand more into trying this type of recipe instead of dealing with the whole grain and hops thing, since this doesn't take much time and effort and I've got a kid screaming at me all the time. 

 I wasn't sure what kind of yeast would be best and in the video he mentions champagne yeast, so I got a sampler from Amazon and went with cuvee. I let my brew ferment overnight, about 16 hours, and got only a little bit of bubble from it this morning. I bottled a little bit to see what it would do after about a week but with the rest (I made a gallon) I added about a half a cup more of a brown sugar and warm water mix and added a little bit more yeast as well. I've been letting that sit for about 4 hours now and it is still fermenting, I can see the bubbles still working. I expect it might be done closer to this evening and I'll bottle the rest of what's in the pot and let it sit for a week.

It's plenty sweet and I'll definitely be experimenting more with different flavors later on but one thing it's lacking is the crispness. I'm not sure what I need to be doing to achieve this or if with this very simple recipe that it just isn't possible.

Impact of multiple strains and pitch-time cell count on attenuation,"I have spent time reading up on and familiarizing myself with a lot of different brewing calculations, one of which is the formula to predict the FG:

    AA = apparent attenuation
    FG = OG - (AA x OG - AA)
    Example: FG = 1.050 - (.75(1.050) - .75) = 1.0125

Reading the book entitled ""*Yeast*"" (White &amp; Zainasheff), they mention strategies of using multiple yeast strains on a brew, and on reading this, it broke my brain a little. Its the concept of combining certain strains that impart different fermentation characteristics to the final product. Sounds cool. But the impact on the calculations!

I suppose I could just take the average AA of all the strains and use that in the above formula, however I would be open to any more accurate, sophisticated models if they exist.

But it got me thinking: what if you pitch 100 billion cells of strain 1, and 50 billion cells of strain 2...shouldn't pitch cell count impact attenuation (and thus FG) as well?! Even for a single strain fermentation? I would imagine that if I pitch thirty (30) cells of a yeast strain into my 5-gallon wort, it will attenuate differently than if I pitch 300 *billion* cells, right? So why isn't pitching cell count an input parameter to the FG calculation?",Homebrewing

Hop uptake vs concentration,"I am considering making my own hop concentrate.

My typical beer brews use 1 to 3 oz. hops in about 5 gallons of wort. My question is, would I still get the same amount of compounds out of the hops if they're only boiled in, say, 0.5 to 1 gallons of water?

Grainfather G30 Connect Potential Serious Issue,"Sorry if this has been posted before but I though I should warn any other Grainfather users of a potential serious issue with the system. The issue involves the retaining ring that the grain basket sits on during sparging.

I have had the system for over two years now and when I first got the system I noticed that the lugs on the base of the grain basket had a tendency to pull the ring slightly out of the recess that it sits in, and if you twisted the basket to seat it on the ring better it would pull the ring out of the recess and the basket would slip into the boiler and could end up with hot wort everywhere. 

To address the issue I ended up bending the lugs on the grain basket out slightly and this stopped the ring from being pulled out of the recess and then I had no problems with it. However I have found that if you have a stuck sparge, then stirring the grains while the grain basket is sat on the ring is a dangerous idea. I tried this on my last brew and the basket lugs pulled the ring out of its recess and the basket dropped into the hot wort, I managed to skip out of the way but it was pure luck that I did.

Anyone else had issue with the basket retaining ring? I am thinking that there might be a  mod that could be made to block the gap in the ring, this would stop it from closing and falling out of the recess, anyone heard of such a thing?",Homebrewing

How Does Yeast Production Fluctuate in Low Temperature Swings (+/- 1 degree)?,"Hi all. This is my first post here, and excited to see what the community has offered - especially to a new homebrewer such as myself. Now let's get into it!   


I recently have been getting a lot more into the tracking of the fermentation process, as I realized this was an area where I was absolutely in the dark. I recently decided to purchase a couple Tilt units, hooked them up to a TiltPi which is recording to BrewFather, and have noticed some interesting trends I was curious about. In a Pliny Clone batch, OG 1.089, 2 Packets of Safale US-05, with relatively low temperatures of 66-70 degrees I've noticed a couple trends in specific gravity that I'm particularly curious about.    


Yeast production (consumption of sugars / lowering the SG) is ABSOLUTELY the strongest (\~  - .010 SG) during times of increased temperature, or decreased temperature (+ or - 1 degree F) , but the brew tends to stall when temperatures stay the same such as during the day.   


Is this something that other brewers notice on their continuously monitored batches? Is this more of a function of the yeast consuming in ""cycles"" or is this a fight or flight mechanism for lack of a better term?

I'm not super sure when to add things and what amounts in secondary like fruit and oaks cubes, so I would definitely appreciate some help there. Most of my experience is with mead and this would only be my 3rd all grain brew.

"Stainless Steel Fermenter: Sovereign, Anvil, or ?","I broke one of my 6.5 gallon glass primaries and figured I’d get a stainless one this time. How do the Sovereign 8.4 gallon and Anvil 7.5 gallon compare? They’re priced similarly, although I can get the Sovereign a bit cheaper. I usually soak my fermenters in ice water to control temperature, so any leaks around the valve are a no-go. Is one better than the other? Is there a different one I should be looking at?",Homebrewing
Keg fermenting hazy IPA,"Having a reoccurring issue that I thought I’d throw out there and see if anyone has any insight. 

I ferment in a ball lock corny keg. When I brew dry hopped beers I use a dry hop cylinder that has a hole drilled into the top for my dip tube so I can take samples and rack to a serving keg without dealing with clogged posts etc etc. Three times now I’ve brewed hazy IPA’s this way and each time everything goes great through the process. I dry hop cold, so I purge with co2 and keep the fermenter under pressure to avoid oxygen exposure etc. Samples pulled via the liquid out post are great. Literally up to the minute I’m moving to a serving keg. 

When I move the beer to a serving keg, I sanitize everything meticulously. Fill the keg to the top with sanitizer and purge with co2 including the liquid to liquid jumper I use to rack. I also use a spunding valve on the serving keg when I rack over. 

All three times I’ve brewed this the beer pours super muted flavor wise from the kegerator. It was super green just a couple days prior from a 6oz cryo dry hop. I’ve gone to great lengths to avoid oxygen during the cold side process and I have a hard time thinking that’s the issue. The only variable at play is the 300 micron hop filter I use over my dip tube. Every other beer I brew does not have this problem. 

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance",Homebrewing
Cold crash issues,"After the diacetyl rest of a lager, what temp would you say the inevitable suction process would begin? 

My last märzen was kinda ruined because I did a rest, then crashed using a glycol chiller. I had the blow-off tube in a jug of star san and it sucked up almost a half gallon plus O2 into my batch 😭. I made a new batch (this time more of a schwarzbier) and still want to cold crash before kegging, but am wondering if I should just keg after the rest, then lager from there.",Homebrewing
SS Brewtech FTSs - is it worth it?,"Santa has told me that he is considering getting me an SS Brewbucket and maybe the FTSs chiller. I am yet to add temperature control to my setup and I know how important it is for brewing. I am saving up for my own place to move out from the 'rents so a chest freezer isn't really an option due to space/convenience. I figured that the FTSs would be a good alternative for the mean time. 

I don't have plans to lager, though it would be cool. I don't know if I could just make a glycol solution with the water and pump that through the coil, would that work or no?

I'm also interested as to how good the heating element is. Generally I end up fermenting too hot, so I don't think I'll really need this bit (and I'm also aware, or at least I've been led to believe, that the two don't work at once. You ned to plug either the heating or cooling element and can't rely on it to just switch).",Homebrewing
"Supersweet DIPA - Possible stuck fermentation as well, help!","Took a two year hiatus from brewing due to a variety of factors. Back to it on Monday past.

It's a tried and tested recipe based on the Cloudwater DIPA v3 provided by the head brewer. We fuck around with the dry hops every time we brew it depending on what is my preference at the time. Always bittered with Chinook in the boil, Citra whirlpool and then a mix of Citra and whatever dry hop I'm enjoying.

Anyway:

7kg Golden Promise
500g Dextrose
20g Chinook (boil)
80g Citra (whirlpool)
Yeast Bay Vermont Ale &amp; US-05 as a helper yeast
3 step mash - 65c for 10, 67c for 35, 70c for 40 and sparge. 

Bloody thermometer broke at step two of mash so had to 'approximate' temps. Post mash gravity was meant to be 1.100ish, came out at 1.050. Pumped up the dextrose to 750g in the boil and then 100g of Chinook to offset. Came out at 1.090 post boil. 

It's in my fermentation chamber at 18c.Took a sample and reading today it's 1.080. Taste was... cloyingly sweet. 

Will obv keep testing it for next 5-10 days hoping it will balance. Will be putting dry hops in too. Will need kegged for 18th Dec too.

Now, am I panicking about sweetness?",Homebrewing

Can acid additions give bad hangovers? or is it likely a different cause?,"So our brews have a tendency to give the drinker a notable hangover, even after just a few 500ml bottles. Seriously been racking our brains to figure out what's causing it, I was hoping Reddit might have some suggestions? 

One thing specifically that I've been wondering is whether it could be caused by the HCL &amp; HSO that we use to tweak the SO/Cl ratio not being food grade. We've been told it is by the lab supplying us but I'm running out of other possible causes. We brew 50 Litre batches and generally use &lt;20ml of acid at a strength of 2 Mole. If the acid isn't food grade could the impurities be the cause of the hangovers especially consuming such a small quantity in the beer? 

I may be clutching at straws here, so any other idea's/experience with this shared are welcome.",Homebrewing

First brew - is it OK to start bottleing ?,"Hi all,  


This is my very first brew, I don't have any equipment to check the gravity of the beer, and I am trying to work out whether or not I should wait more before bottleing the beer.  


* It's been almost 3 weeks in the fermenter.
* I can still see lots small bubbles appearing in the fermenter, and bits of sediments floating up and down here and there
* I still see the plastic cap in the airlock raised up because of CO2 pressure
* My house is definitely colder than expected

&amp;#x200B;

All those points makes think I don't want to bottle right now, as I don't want pressure building up in the bottles.  
I'm thinking the fact that my house is cold slowed down the fermentation process.   
Am I wrong ? is it common to see these things even when the beer is ready to be bottled ?",Homebrewing
